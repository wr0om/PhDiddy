2021: Hybrid Speech and Text Analysis Methods for Speaker Change Detection
Abstract: Speaker Change Detection (SCD) is the task of segmenting an input audio-recording according to speaker interchanges. Nowadays, many applications, such as Speaker Diarization (SD) or automatic vocal transcription, depend on this segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on the essential task of the SD problem, the audio segmenting process, and suggest a solution for the SCD problem, as well as the assignment of clustered speaker labels for the extracted segments, and applying the solution over two datasets: a commercial dataset in Hebrew and the ICSI Meeting Corpus. As such, we propose a hybrid framework for the SCD problem that is learned by textual information and speech signals and the meta-data features that can be extracted from them. Moreover, we demonstrate the negative correlation between an increase in the number of speakers in the training dataset and the influence on the overall diarization system's performance, which is improved using our efficient SCD component. Finally, we show how our proposed hybrid framework remains robust compared to the ICSI Meeting Corpus, as the experimental evaluation's training and testing is based on two languages.

2015: Quantifying driver's field-of-view in tractors: methodology and case study
Abstract: When driving a car, the visual awareness is important for operating and controlling the vehicle. When operating a tractor, it is even more complex. This is because the driving is always accompanied with another task (e.g., plough) that demands constant changes of body postures, to achieve the needed Field-of-View (FoV). Therefore, the cockpit must be well designed to provide best FoV. Today, the driver's FoV is analyzed mostly by computer simulations of a cockpit model and a Digital Human Model (DHM) positioned inside. The outcome is an ‘Eye view’ that displays what the DHM ‘sees’. This paper suggests a new approach that adds quantitative information to the current display; presented on three tractor models as case studies. Based on the results, the design can be modified. This may assist the engineer, to analyze, compare and improve the design, for better addressing the driver needs.

2015: Harnessing an Ergonomic Solution for Prolonged Sitting in Flight
Abstract: Low-back pain is one of the consequences of sitting. Muscular fatigue leads to shifting from a straight posture into a slumped one. We believe that corrective supports to the pelvis and lumbar spine must be complemented with restraining shoulder straps to bypass muscle fatigue. This ergonomic design “formula” could potentially improve prolonged passive sitting conditions, such as on long-haul flights, in which most passengers sit in cramped surroundings. Our study’s results confirm this hypothesis. Further studies are required concerning cardiac and circulatory responses to the use of this device.

2013: Ergonomics improvements for the human operator—Cost effectiveness approach
Abstract: None

2013: Ergonomic Design: Experimental Studies of Multi-Task Vehicle
Abstract: The design of off-road vehicles is complicated. Particularly when the driving, is accompanied with another task, simultaneously (e.g. plowing). Such a complex environment may lead to human error and end up with an accident. In Aus-tralia, 20-25 percent of vehicle accidents’ casualties are from off-road accidents. The literature suggests three combined and important aspects, in vehicle design: vision control, anthropometrical fitting and biomechanical considerations. No study is found which supports an off-road vehicle design from all three aspects together. In addition, the extensive use of computer aided design (CAD) in the vehicles’ design stages, produce only qualitative results. This study presents a pioneering expe-rimental ergonomic research, of an off-road cabin design. The research inquires the three aspects,combined, generating quantitative results. These results produce a better fitted design to the operator and his operational needs, which help the engineer to design a cabinthat may lead to less strenuous sitting postures and fatigue.

2012: Design Considerations to Enhance the Safety of Patient Compartments in Ambulance Transporters
Abstract: Abstract The safety of the interior of ambulances is dubious and, in the event of sudden impact during emergency transport, potentially perilous to patients they carry. The workplace ergonomics of the interior of the passenger cabin is lacking. This article discusses an improved ergonomic interior design based on study findings, observations and subjective perception. It suggests design aspects and safety concepts aimed at increasing the safety of patients and paramedic staff inside the ambulance as a mobile workstation.

2012: A Manpower Allocation Model for Service Jobs
Abstract: While the work measurement concept has evolved from the manufacturing world, it has not been fully adopted yet to the global shift into the service sector. Certain factors create inherent difficulties in determining time standards for manpower allocation in service jobs: (a) wide variation in Time Between Arrivals and Service Performance Time and (b) the difficulty of assessing the damage done to the organization by long customer Waiting Times (WT) for service. This difficulty makes it hard to calculate the Break-Even Point (BEP) between raising worker output, which minimizes labor costs but increases customer WT, and improving service quality by lowering customer WT. The model proposed overcomes most of the difficulties by taking a multi-domain approach to the problem: 1) The model deploys a series of indicators for a correlation between output and WT. The indicator values are affected by service level of urgency and the initial number of service workers and 2) Cost-Benefit â€“ finding the best BEP by comparing the operational cost of an additional worker with the economical benefit caused by the decrease in WT at the margin. Thus, the model finds the best balance between worker output and service quality.

2010: Minimising idle times in cluster tools in the semiconductor industry
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the problem of sequencing handler's moves in cluster tools in the semiconductor industry. A suboptimal sequence of the handler's moves usually leads to long idle times in the cluster tool's chambers and hence longer makespan and lower throughput. Therefore, an effective algorithm that minimises idle times in the cluster tool's chambers is required. An algorithm called MinBIT (minimising bottleneck idle time) is presented as a new method for sequencing the handler's moves. The MinBIT algorithm gives priority to the bottleneck stage, and thus leads to a reduction in unnecessary idle times and hence a shorter makespan. We compared the MinBIT algorithm with other algorithms. Our algorithm achieved best performance in 98% of the cases. In the other 2% of the cases it achieved second or third best performance. The computational results show that the MinBIT algorithm can improve the performance of a cluster tool by up to 10%. A comparison between the MinBIT solutions and the optimal solutions found by using branch and bound, shows that the deviation between them ranged between 0% and 0.22%, which indicates that MinBIT gives optimal or near optimal results.

2007: Ergonomic Evaluation of the Ambulance Interior to Reduce Paramedic Discomfort and Posture Stress
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to evaluate safety and accessibility of an advanced life support (ALS) ambulance interior. Background: The standard ambulance's interior design is unsatisfactory based on perceived discomfort and postures that constrain paramedics and medical staff, resulting in unsafe treatment of patients, mainly when being transported. Methods: Two procedures were used to evaluate performance during a wide range of rescue tasks: a survey, based on questionnaires, interviews, and observation of paramedics performing routine tasks; and upper body and back posture analysis, based on postural considerations. Results: Findings revealed that 74% of the paramedics stated that the location of the paramedic's seat is inefficient while they perform clinical procedures; 94% found the bench uncomfortable; 77% felt that the vertical distance between the bench and the stretcher is too far; and 86% needed to steady themselves when the vehicle was moving. Posture analysis showed that paramedics undergo several nonneutral back postures, including twisted back (>20°) and sitting with back flexion between 20° and 45°. Conclusion: Because the interior of the ALS ambulance was found to be unsatisfactory both to paramedics and patients, alternative design issues are proposed. Application: The suggested practical layout contains four main modifications: (a) replacing the bench with two adjustable paramedic seats, (b) redesigning the medical cabinet for easy access, (c) adding an adjustable folding seat opposite the two new seats, and (d) adding a swiveling base and lifting apparatus that will accommodate the stretcher and enable better accessibility to patients by the paramedic personnel.

2006: Rapid video-based analysis system for advanced work measurement
Abstract: A digital video-based approach is proposed to enhance work measurement and analysis by facilitating the generation of rapid time standards. This approach takes conservative videotaped analysis a giant step forward. A genuine description of the work situation is imported into the analytical system via digital video input, thereby enabling a free-of-work site attendance study for evaluating time and work performance. The proposed method serves as a computerized tool for remote work measurement with the ability to derive rapid generation of time standards. The paper verifies the method's abilities for rapid generation of time standards through five case studies. It compares the performance of work analysts for making a MOST (Maynard Operation Sequence Technique) study using the proposed method versus using traditional videotape analysis. About 40% of the time devoted to work measurement and analysis can be saved using this technique.

2006: Time-based approach to obtain quantitative measures for ergonomics hazard analysis
Abstract: The paper describes a methodology for conducting an ergonomic analysis that allows ergonomists to gather data while off site. The analysis described is carried out on portable computing devices, using common computer applications. It includes data collection via a camera on the manufacturing floor and conversion into a digital format. Software is suggested for playback and semi-automatic work sampling of work cycles while recording observations to electronic form, to generate rapidly the analysis of results. Snapshot observations are made on frozen video frames that are categorized into work elements, upper body joint posture and static/dynamic effort. Using two case studies, it is shown how the approach may be implemented as a procedure of choice to complete a quantitative work analysis.

2006: Inserting cost effectiveness to the ergonomic equation when considering practical solutions
Abstract: From a practical point of view, the cost effectiveness of ergonomic solutions is often questioned. Many times managers omit ergonomic solutions because of their high cost. This paper introduces a way to implement cost effective ergonomic solutions by coupling computer-aided design and predetermined motion time systems. This is done by generating a comparison between the operation times and body motions used in existing and safer work situations. We demonstrate using two case studies how solutions may impact operation times and stress, to which workers are subjected, which may be expressed in relaxation allowances required for resting and recovery. The ‘final product’ which may interest management the most, the ergonomic recommendations, is presented in easy to understand figures and numbers, including time to return on investment on relevant ergonomic solutions, which becomes possible when suggested improvements to work-situations are translated to time and cost.

2002: Three-Dimensional Lifting Model For Non-Homogeneous Loads
Abstract: A 3-dimensional model and analysis methodology is suggested for treating lifting tasks when unbalanced loads are involved. The paper describes the biomechanical equations that are coupled with the worker’s posture geometry, to address a practical problem of non-symmetric lifting. The analysis has a dominant biomechanical modeling scope, as it contains a breakdown of the internal lifting forces resulting from posture and external loads acting on the body. The load model represents the acting forces due to unbalanced lifting, which is commonly found in industrial situations. The suggested model allows the user to simulate the influence of the practical load distribution, aiding safe design of a lifting job.

2002: Lifter, a Computerized Lifting Analysis Technique
Abstract: A computer driven technique to analyze lifting forces, in non-homogeneous load situations, is described and tested. Analysis is based on a dynamic algorithm aimed to evaluate unconstrained lifting posture and non-homogeneous content of loads. For inputs we use actual geometrical body postures in the form of 3-dimensional co-ordinates obtained from pictures taken at a work site. The outputs show a good match between the findings and pre-study assumptions for balanced and non-balanced load lifting practice. The results of the experiments show a good degree of correlation with results reported by researchers for symmetrical lifting tasks and with National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOSH) lifting guidelines. It is believed that the technique can serve as the proper choice for industrial and safety analysts of lifting activities.

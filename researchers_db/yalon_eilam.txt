2025: Asymmetric and Symmetric Single-Pole Double-Throw With Improved Power Handling Using Indirectly Heated Phase-Change Switches
Abstract: Four-terminal indirectly heated phase-change switches (IPCSs) have emerged as excellent candidates for radio-frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) applications due to their state-of-the-art cutoff frequency, nonvolatility, CMOS compatibility, and exceptional linearity. However, IPCS performance is limited by relatively low-power handling capabilities in the off-state, limited by the Ovonic threshold switching (OTS) phenomenon. In this article, we propose the use of a quad configuration consisting of two series-connected IPCS in parallel with another two series-connected IPCS. This series connection increases the effective threshold voltage, thereby enhancing power handling compared to a single device. We experimentally demonstrate the implementation of this quad configuration in asymmetric and symmetric single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches. Fabricated using an in-house process, these designs achieve an insertion loss (IL) below 0.8 dB and isolation higher than 17 dB within the dc-15 GHz frequency band. Furthermore, we explore techniques, such as reducing the probing pads and series-shunt configuration, to boost isolation beyond 30 dB. Thanks to the quad configuration, the threshold voltage increases from 5 to 13.5 V, predicatively enabling power handling above 35 dBm.

2024: Crystallization dynamics probed by transient resistance in phase change memory cells
Abstract: Crystallization (set) time is a key bottleneck to achieve high-speed programming in phase change memory (PCM). Overcoming this limitation requires a deeper understanding of the solidification processes within nanoscale device configuration. This study explores crystallization dynamics in Ge2Sb2Te5 by measuring the transient resistance and power during the set process in confined PCM cells with nanosecond resolution. The transient resistance probes the phase, while the power can be used to evaluate temperature, thus uncovering details of the phase change dynamics. Our findings reveal a notable trend indicating that solidification from the melt results in faster crystallization compared with annealing the glassy state. Moreover, we observed notable differences in the solidification dynamics during set (crystallization) and reset (amorphization) pulses. Our nanosecond transient measurement methodology proves valuable in revealing crucial aspects of PCM crystallization dynamics, holding the potential to enable higher-speed programming.

2024: Resistance Drift Reset State and Read Voltage Dependencies in Phase Change Memory
Abstract: Using Phase-change memory as artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing hardware is severely limited by resistance drift. This drift depends on the initial resistance state, and devices show non-linear I-V characteristics indicating that the PCM resistance also depends on the read voltage. Here we present an electrical characterization methodology to asses these dependencies. We measure 180 reset cycles and perform statistical analysis. Our methodology can be used to better predict drift dependencies, ultimately mitigating it.

2024: The Role of Interface Band Alignment in Epitaxial SrTiO3/GaAs Heterojunctions
Abstract: Correlated oxides are known to have remarkable properties, with a range of electronic, magnetic, optoelectronic, and photonic functionalities. A key ingredient in realizing these properties into practical technology is the effective and scalable integration of oxides with conventional semiconductors. Unlocking the full spectrum of functionality requires atomically abrupt oxide–semiconductor interfaces and intimate knowledge of their potential landscape and charge transport. In this study, we investigated the electrical properties of epitaxial SrTiO3/GaAs heterostructures by examining the band alignment and transport behavior at the interface. We employ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to measure the barriers for electrons and holes across the interface and, through them, explain the transport behavior for junctions with n- and p-type GaAs. We further show qualitative evidence of the strong photoresponse of these structures, illustrating the potential of these structures in optoelectronic devices. These results establish the fundamental groundwork for utilizing these interfaces toward new devices and define their design space.

2024: Drift of Schottky Barrier Height in Phase Change Materials
Abstract: Phase-change memory (PCM) devices have great potential as multilevel memory cells and artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing hardware. However, their practical use is hampered by resistance drift, a phenomenon commonly attributed to structural relaxation or electronic mechanisms primarily in the context of bulk effects. In this study, we reevaluate the electrical manifestation of resistance drift in sub-100 nm Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) PCM devices, focusing on the contributions of bulk vs interface effects. We employ a combination of measurement techniques to elucidate the current transport mechanism and the electrical manifestation of resistance drift. Our steady-state temperature-dependent measurements reveal that resistance in these devices is predominantly influenced by their electrical contacts, with conduction occurring through thermionic emission (Schottky) at the contacts. Additionally, temporal current–voltage characterization allows us to link the resistance drift to a time-dependent increase in the Schottky barrier height. These findings provide valuable insights, pinpointing the primary contributor to resistance drift in PCM devices: the Schottky barrier height for hole injection at the interface. This underscores the significance of contacts (interface) in the electrical manifestation of drift in PCM devices.

2024: Interfacial Engineering of Degenerately Doped V0.25Mo0.75S2 for Improved Contacts in MoS2 Field Effect Transistors
Abstract: 2D transition‐metal dichalcogenide semiconductors such as MoS2 are identified as a platform for next‐generation electronic circuitries. However, the progress toward industrial applications is still lagging due to imperfections of wafer‐scale deposition techniques and in‐contact parasitic impedance affecting device integration in large circuits and systems. Here, on contact engineering of large‐scale, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown monolayer MoS2 films is reported, leading to improved performance of field effect transistors. The transistor performance of monolayer pure MoS2 is initially characterized by its ION/IOFF ratio (106), carrier density (≈1012 cm−2), and mobility (≈10 cm2 Vs−1), and the Schottky barrier height (SBH) of conventional metallic Au contact of MoS2 (≈215 meV). Then, a CVD‐grown degenerately‐doped monolayer of alloy V0.25Mo0.75S2 is introduced between Au and MoS2 of a modified transistor, reducing the SBH to ≈100 meV. The reduced contact resistance (≈50%) of the device with an atomically thin contact interface complies with the theoretical model and is free from Fermi‐level pinning effects. It is resilient to the high temperatures that are characteristic of physical metallization methods and is readily scalable.

2024: High-Speed Electrical Transient Thermometry of Monolayer MoS2
Abstract: Self-heating greatly limits performance of devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present a novel high-speed thermometry method for 2D semiconductor devices. Utilizing nanosecond pulsed measurements, at timescales shorter than the device thermal time constant, we probe transient self-heating in monolayer MoS2 transistors. We measure temperature-dependent thermal resistance of 2D semiconductor devices, extracting the thermal boundary conductance of monolayer MoS2 in a wide temperature range. Our results offer insights into 2D materials thermal interfaces.

2024: Bitwise Logic Using Phase Change Memory Devices Based on the Pinatubo Architecture
Abstract: This paper experimentally demonstrates a near-crossbar memory logic technique called Pinatubo. Pinatubo, an acronym for Processing In Non-volatile memory ArchiTecture for bUlk Bitwise Operations, facilitates the concurrent activation of two or more rows, enabling bitwise operations such as OR, AND, XOR, and NOT on the activated rows. We implement Pinatubo using phase change memory (PCM) and compare our experimental results with the simulated data from the original Pinatubo study. Our findings highlight a significant four-orders of magnitude difference between resistance states, suggesting the robustness of the Pinatubo architecture with PCM technology.

2024: Charge gain via solid-state gating of an oxide Mott system
Abstract: The modulation of channel conductance in field-effect transistors (FETs) via metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has revolutionized information processing and storage. However, the limitations of silicon-based FETs in electrical switching have driven the search for new materials capable of overcoming these constraints. Electrostatic gating of competing electronic phases in a Mott material near its metal to insulator transition (MIT) offers prospects of substantial modulation of the free carriers and electrical resistivity through small changes in band filling. While electrostatic control of the MIT has been previously reported, the advancement of Mott materials towards novel Mott transistors requires the realization of their charge gain prospects in a solid-state device. In this study, we present gate-control of electron correlation using a solid-state device utilizing the oxide Mott system $La_{1-x}Sr_xVO_3$ as a correlated FET channel. We report on a gate resistance response that cannot be explained in a purely electrostatic framework, suggesting at least $\times100$ charge gain originating from the correlated behavior. These preliminary results pave the way towards the development of highly efficient, low-power electronic devices that could surpass the performance bottlenecks of conventional FETs by leveraging the electronic phase transitions of correlated electron systems.

2024: Exploring Charge Trapping Dynamics in Si:HfO₂-FeFETs by Temperature-Dependent Electrical Characterization
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO2 technology shows promise for non-volatile memory and neuromorphic devices. However, charge trapping limits their performance. This work presents temperature-dependent electrical characterization that reveals distinct memory window behaviors, transitioning from ferroelectric to trapping. Our measurements span six orders of magnitude in time, and ambient temperatures of 80-300 K. Analysis of threshold voltage, memory window, and de-trapping dynamics extracts a trap energy level of ~0.2 eV, providing crucial insights for advancing FE HfO2-based FeFETs technology.

2023: Sub-Nanosecond Switching of Si:HfO2 Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistor.
Abstract: The discovery of ferroelectric doped HfO2 enabled the emergence of scalable and CMOS-compatible ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) technology which has the potential to meet the growing need for fast, low-power, low-cost, and high-density nonvolatile memory, and neuromorphic devices. Although HfO2 FeFETs have been widely studied in the past few years, their fundamental switching speed is yet to be explored. Importantly, the shortest polarization time demonstrated to date in HfO2-based FeFET was ∼10 ns. Here, we report that a single subnanosecond pulse can fully switch HfO2-based FeFET. We also study the polarization switching kinetics across 11 orders of magnitude in time (300 ps to 8 s) and find a remarkably steep time-voltage relation, which is captured by the classical nucleation theory across this wide range of pulse widths. These results demonstrate the high-speed capabilities of FeFETs and help better understand their fundamental polarization switching speed limits and switching kinetics.

2023: High Number of Transport Modes: A Requirement for Contact Resistance Reduction to Atomically Thin Semiconductors
Abstract: Electrical contacts to atomically thin 2-D semiconductors are considered as the hindering aspect of electronic devices based on these materials. The high resistance of such contacts stems from their Schottky nature in contrast to the desired low-resistance Ohmic contacts. This issue of Schottky contacts is thus one of the major inhibitors to the integration of 2-D materials into mainstream technology. In this work, we explore contact resistance (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) to atomically thin 2-D semiconductors in terms of the injected current through the Schottky barrier (SB) by using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism as well as experimental measurements and technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations. We show that the SB height and width, which are determined by the metal–semiconductor interface and the number of charge carriers in the semiconductor channel, respectively, affect <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> when it is relatively high (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}} >$ </tex-math></inline-formula> 1 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\text{k}\Omega \cdot \mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). However, the number of transport modes for carrier injection is the limiting factor for aggressive <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> lowering (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}} < $ </tex-math></inline-formula> 1 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\text{k}\Omega \cdot \mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), even for near-zero SB height. Our results show that to reduce <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}_{\text {C}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> below <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$100~\Omega \cdot \mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, large number of transport modes are required, which can be accomplished through raising the number of channel carriers above 5. 1013 cm-2 by means of heavy doping or gating. Our conclusions offer insight for future contact engineering and can explain recently published state-of-the-art results.

2023: Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of Ge2Sb2Te5 polymorphs from 80 to 500 K
Abstract: We report the thermal conductivity of amorphous, cubic, and hexagonal Ge2Sb2Te5 using time-domain thermoreflectance from 80 to 500 K. The measured thermal conductivities are 0.20 W m−1 K−1 for amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5, 0.63 W m−1 K−1 for the cubic phase, and 1.45 W m−1 K−1 for the hexagonal phase at room temperature. For amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5, the thermal conductivity increases monotonically with temperature when T < 300 K, showing a typical glass-like temperature dependence, and increases dramatically after heating up to 435 K due to partial crystallization to the cubic phase. For hexagonal Ge2Sb2Te5, electronic contribution to thermal conductivity is significant. The lattice thermal conductivity of the hexagonal phase shows a relatively low value of 0.47 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and has a temperature dependence of T−1 when T > 100 K, suggesting that phonon–phonon scattering dominates its lattice thermal conductivity. Although cubic Ge2Sb2Te5 has a similar grain size to hexagonal Ge2Sb2Te5, its thermal conductivity shows a glass-like trend like that of the amorphous phase, indicating a high concentration of vacancies that strongly scatter heat-carrying phonons. These thermal transport mechanisms of Ge2Sb2Te5 polymorphs help improve the thermal design of phase change memory devices for more energy-efficient non-volatile memory.

2023: Reconfigurable Low-Voltage Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nonvolatile Switches for Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communications.
Abstract: Recently, nonvolatile resistive switching memory effects have been actively studied in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides and boron nitrides to advance future memory and neuromorphic computing applications. Here, we report on radiofrequency (RF) switches utilizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) memristors that afford operation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) range. Notably, silver (Ag) electrodes to h-BN offer outstanding nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching characteristics with a high ON/OFF switching ratio of 1011 and low switching voltage below 0.34 V. In addition, the switch exhibits a low insertion loss of 0.50 dB and high isolation of 23 dB across the D-band spectrum (110 to 170 GHz). Furthermore, the S21 insertion loss can be tuned through five orders of current compliance magnitude, which increases the application prospects for atomic switches. These results can enable the switch to become a key component for future reconfigurable wireless and 6G communication systems.

2023: Nanoscale temperature sensing of electronic devices with calibrated scanning thermal microscopy
Abstract: Heat dissipation threatens the performance and lifetime of many electronic devices. As the size of devices shrinks to the nanoscale, we require spatially and thermally resolved thermometry to observe their fine thermal features. Scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) has proven to be a versatile measurement tool for characterizing the temperature at the surface of devices with nanoscale resolution. SThM can obtain qualitative thermal maps of a device using an operating principle based on a heat exchange process between a thermo-sensitive probe and the sample surface. However, the quantification of these thermal features is one of the most challenging parts of this technique. Developing reliable calibration approaches for SThM is therefore an essential aspect to accurately determine the temperature at the surface of a sample or device. In this work, we calibrate a thermo-resistive SThM probe using heater-thermometer metal lines with different widths (50 nm to 750 nm), which mimic variable probe-sample thermal exchange processes. The sensitivity of the SThM probe when scanning the metal lines is also evaluated under different probe and line temperatures. Our results reveal that the calibration factor depends on the probe measuring conditions and on the size of the surface heating features. This approach is validated by mapping the temperature profile of a phase change electronic device. Our analysis provides new insights on how to convert the thermo-resistive SThM probe signal to the scanned device temperature more accurately.

2023: Ionic–electronic dynamics in an electrochemical gate stack toward high-speed artificial synapses
Abstract: Despite their great synaptic potential, the trade-off between programming speed and energy consumption of electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM) devices are major hindrance to their incorporation into practical applications. In this work, we experimentally study the main limiting factor for high-speed programming of ECRAMs, the ionic current in the gate stack. We use two-terminal structures composed of LiCoO2/Li3PO4/amorphous-Si to represent the ECRAM gate stack (reservoir/electrolyte/channel). We perform electrical characterization including impedance spectroscopy (small-signal) and large-signal transient measurements across nine orders of magnitude in the time domain. We find that at the sub-microseconds range, the current is governed by the energy barrier for Li+ ions at the electrolyte interfaces. After a period of ∼1 μs, ionic migration through the ∼80 nm electrolyte layer dictates the current. At ∼50 μs, the ionic double layer at the interface is fully charged and the gate current drops by several orders of magnitude, indicating that the Li3PO4/Si interface is saturated, and the measured current is dominated by the electronic leakage component. Furthermore, we evaluate ECRAM performance under various pulse parameters. Our predictions show that an aggressively scaled (atomically thin) channel having a low carrier density of ∼1011 cm−2 can be programmed at ∼nanosecond using a gate current of ∼100 A/cm2.

2025: Hierarchy of Pseudo-Random Array Codes
Abstract: Pseudo-random arrays are the two-dimensional analog of M-sequences. Pseudo-random array codes are the two-dimensional analog of sequences generated by a product of irreducible polynomials with the same exponent. The union of the arrays in such a code has the window property and the shift-and-add property, implying that these codes are linear. The folding technique is the most basic one for forming such arrays and codes. A new criterion for generating pseudo-random arrays based on folding is given. This new criterion yields pseudo-random arrays with new parameters. A general construction for such array codes is given. It appears that the arrays generated in this construction can be constructed by folding the nonzero sequences generated by a product of irreducible polynomials of the same degree and the same exponent. Two hierarchies of the pseudo-random array codes are provided. In one hierarchy codewords of one code with smaller windows are contained in codewords of another code which stands above him in the hierarchy. The second hierarchy is a partition of the pseudo-random array codes generated by folding into classes based on the polynomial types which participate in their construction.

2025: On de Bruijn Array Codes—Part I: Nonlinear Codes
Abstract: A de Bruijn array code is a set of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$r \times s$ </tex-math></inline-formula> binary doubly-periodic arrays such that each binary <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n \times m$ </tex-math></inline-formula> matrix is contained exactly once as a window in one of the arrays. Such a set of arrays can be viewed as a two-dimensional generalization of a perfect factor in the de Bruijn graph. Necessary conditions for the existence of such codes are proved. Several direct constructions and recursive constructions for such arrays are presented. A framework for a theory of two-dimensional feedback shift registers which is akin to (one-dimensional) feedback shift registers is suggested in the process.

2024: Recovery Sets of Subspaces From a Simplex Code
Abstract: Recovery sets for vectors and subspaces are important in the construction of distributed storage system codes. These concepts are also interesting in their own right. In this paper, we consider the following very basic recovery question: what is the maximum number of possible pairwise disjoint recovery sets for each recovered element? The recovered elements in this work are <italic>d</italic>-dimensional subspaces of a <italic>k</italic>-dimensional vector space over <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mathbb {F}_{q}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. Each server stores one representative for each distinct one-dimensional subspace of the <italic>k</italic>-dimensional vector space, or equivalently a distinct point of PG<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$(k-1,q)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. As column vectors, the associated vectors of the stored one-dimensional subspaces form the generator matrix of the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$[(q^{k} -1)/(q-1),k,q^{k-1}]$ </tex-math></inline-formula> simplex code over <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mathbb {F}_{q}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. Lower bounds and upper bounds on the maximum number of such recovery sets are provided. It is shown that generally, these bounds are either tight or very close to being tight.

2024: On Nearly Perfect Covering Codes
Abstract: Nearly perfect packing codes are those codes that meet the Johnson upper bound on the size of error-correcting codes. This bound is an improvement to the sphere-packing bound. A related bound for covering codes is known as the van Wee bound. Codes that meet this bound will be called nearly perfect covering codes. In this paper, such codes with covering radius one will be considered. It will be proved that these codes can be partitioned into three families depending on the smallest distance between neighboring codewords. Some of the codes contained in these families will be completely characterized. Other properties of these codes will be considered too. Construction for codes for each such family will be presented, the weight distribution and the distance distribution of codes from these families are characterized. Finally, extended nearly perfect covering code will be considered and unexpected equivalence classes of codes of the three types will be defined based on the extended codes.

2024: Maximum Length RLL Sequences in de Bruijn Graph
Abstract: Free-space quantum key distribution requires to synchronize the transmitted and received signals. A timing and synchronization system for this purpose based on a de Bruijn sequence has been proposed and studied recently for a channel associated with quantum communication that requires reliable synchronization. To avoid a long period of no-pulse in such a system on-off pulses are used to simulate a \emph{zero} and on-on pulses are used to simulate a \emph{one}. However, these sequences have high redundancy and low rate. To reduce the redundancy and increase the rate, run-length limited sequences in the de Bruijn graph are proposed for the same purpose. The maximum length of such sequences in the de Bruijn graph is studied and an efficient algorithm to construct a large set of these sequences is presented. Based on known algorithms and enumeration methods, maximum length sequence for which the position of each window can be computed efficiently is presented and an enumeration on the number of such sequences is given.

2024: Repairing a Single Erasure in Reed-Solomon Codes with Side Information
Abstract: We generalize the problem of recovering a lost/erased symbol in a Reed-Solomon code to the scenario in which some side information about the lost symbol is known. The side information is represented as a set $S$ of linearly independent combinations of the sub-symbols of the lost symbol. When $S=\varnothing$, this reduces to the standard problem of repairing a single codeword symbol. When $S$ is a set of sub-symbols of the erased one, this becomes the repair problem with partially lost/erased symbol. We first establish that the minimum repair bandwidth depends on $\vert S\vert$ and not the content of $S$ and construct a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of a linear repair scheme with side information $S$ We then consider the well-known subspace-polynomial repair schemes and show that their repair bandwidths can be optimized by choosing the right subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate several parameter regimes where the optimal bandwidths can be achieved for full-length Reed-Solomon codes.

2024: Repairing Reed-Solomon Codes with Side Information
Abstract: We generalize the problem of recovering a lost/erased symbol in a Reed-Solomon code to the scenario in which some side information about the lost symbol is known. The side information is represented as a set $S$ of linearly independent combinations of the sub-symbols of the lost symbol. When $S = \varnothing$, this reduces to the standard problem of repairing a single codeword symbol. When $S$ is a set of sub-symbols of the erased one, this becomes the repair problem with partially lost/erased symbol. We first establish that the minimum repair bandwidth depends on $|S|$ and not the content of $S$ and construct a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of a linear repair scheme with side information $S$. We then consider the well-known subspace-polynomial repair schemes and show that their repair bandwidths can be optimized by choosing the right subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate several parameter regimes where the optimal bandwidths can be achieved for full-length Reed-Solomon codes.

2024: Pairs in Nested Steiner Quadruple Systems
Abstract: Motivated by a repair problem for fractional repetition codes in distributed storage, each block of any Steiner quadruple system (SQS) of order $v$ is partitioned into two pairs. Each pair in such a partition is called a nested design pair and its multiplicity is the number of times it is a pair in this partition. Such a partition of each block is considered as a new block design called a nested Steiner quadruple system. Several related questions on this type of design are considered in this paper: What is the maximum multiplicity of the nested design pair with minimum multiplicity? What is the minimum multiplicity of the nested design pair with maximum multiplicity? Are there nested quadruple systems in which all the nested design pairs have the same multiplicity? Of special interest are nested quadruple systems in which all the $\binom{v}{2}$ pairs are nested design pairs with the same multiplicity. Several constructions of nested quadruple systems are considered and in particular classic constructions of SQS are examined.

2024: Repairing with Zero Skip Cost
Abstract: To measure repair latency at helper nodes, we introduce a new metric called skip cost that quantifies the number of contiguous sections accessed on a disk. We provide explicit constructions of zigzag codes and fractional repetition codes that incur zero skip cost.

2024: Representing Information on DNA Using Patterns Induced by Enzymatic Labeling
Abstract: Enzymatic DNA labeling is a powerful tool with applications in biochemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, medical science, and genomic research. This paper contributes to the evolving field of DNA-based data storage by presenting a formal framework for modeling DNA labeling in strings, specifically tailored for data storage purposes. Our approach involves a known DNA molecule as a template for labeling, employing patterns induced by a set of designed labels to represent information. One hypothetical implementation can use CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA reagents for labeling. Various aspects of the general labeling channel, including fixed-length labels, are explored, and upper bounds on the maximal size of the corresponding codes are given. The study includes the development of an efficient encoder-decoder pair that is proven optimal in terms of maximum code size under specific conditions.

2024: Thermal-Aware Channel with Multiple Wires
Abstract: The thermal-aware channel has been studied recently to control the temperature of some electronic devices for better performance and longer lifetime. In this work, we consider a thermal-aware channel model where multiple wires are available to the user. The user can use one wire or several wires to write an information word. Particularly, we study the two extreme cases. In the first case, only one wire is permitted for writing the information. The other extreme case is that we are allowed to write information on all the wires in parallel. In the first case, when we send a message through a wire that reaches the highest allowed temperature, we switch to another available wire. We determine the minimum number of wires required to send any arbitrary message. Given the number of wires, our second task is to determine the constrained codewords that can be sent through these wires. We compute the maximum information rate achieved and provide some constructions of codes satisfying these constraints. In the second case when all the wires are available for writing many, interesting questions arise and we briefly describe one of them and its solutions.

2024: The Capacity of the Weighted Read Channel
Abstract: One of the primary sequencing methods gaining prominence in DNA storage is nanopore sequencing, attributed to various factors. In this work, we consider a simplified model of the sequencer, characterized as a channel. This channel takes a sequence and processes it using a sliding window of length $\ell$, shifting the window by $\delta$ characters each time. The output of this channel, which we refer to as the read vector, is a vector containing the sums of the entries in each of the windows. The capacity of the channel is defined as the maximal information rate of the channel. Previous works have already revealed capacity values for certain parameters $\ell$ and $\delta$. In this work, we show that when $\delta < \ell < 2\delta$, the capacity value is given by $\frac{1}{\delta}\log_{2}\frac{1}{2}(\ell+1+ \sqrt{(\ell+1)^{2}-4(\ell-\delta)(\ell-\delta+1)})$. Additionally, we construct an upper bound when $2\delta < \ell$. Finally, we extend the model to the two-dimensional case and present several results on its capacity.

2024: On de Bruijn Covering Sequences and Arrays
Abstract: An $(m, n, R)-\mathbf{de}$ Bruijn covering array (dBCA) is a doubly periodic $M\times N$ array over an alphabet of size $q$ such that the set of all its $m\times n$ windows form a covering code with radius $R$. An upper bound of the smallest array area of an $(m, n, R)-\mathbf{dBCA}$ is provided using a probabilistic technique which is similar to the one that was used for an upper bound on the length of a de Bruijn covering sequence. A folding technique to construct a dBCA from a de Bruijn covering sequence or de Bruijn covering sequences code is presented. Several new constructions that yield shorter de Bruijn covering sequences and $(m, n, R)-\mathbf{dBCAs}$ with smaller areas are also provided. These constructions are mainly based on sequences derived from cyclic codes, self-dual sequences, primitive polynomials, an interleaving technique, folding, and mutual shifts of sequences with the same covering radius. Finally, constructions of de Bruijn covering sequences codes are also discussed.

2024: Pair-Covering Codes
Abstract: Motivated by distributed algorithms for fuzzy joins, the concept of pair-covering ${}^{\prime\prime}$ codes is defined. This definition is a generalization of the well-known concept of covering codes. Basic properties and bounds for the pair-covering codes with comparison to the associated properties and bounds for covering codes, are provided. In particular, the sphere covering bound and normal codes are generalized.

2023: Thermal-Aware Channel Capacity
Abstract: High temperatures in electronic devices have a negative effect on their performance. Various techniques have been proposed and studied to address and combat this thermal challenge. To guarantee that the peak temperature of the devices will be bounded by some maximum temperature, the transmitted signal has to satisfy some constraints.With this motivation, we study the constrained channel that only accepts sequences that satisfy prescribed thermal constraints. The main goal in this paper is to compute the capacity of this channel. We provide the exact capacity of the channel with some certain parameters and we also present some bounds on the capacity in various cases.Finally, we consider the model that multiple wires are available to use and find out the smallest number of wires required to satisfy the thermal constraints.

2023: Pseduo- Random and de Bruijn Array Codes
Abstract: Pseudo-random arrays and perfect maps are the two-dimensional analogs of M-sequences and de Bruijn sequences, respectively. We modify the definitions to be applied to codes. These codes are also the two-dimensional analogs of certain factors in the de Bruijn graph. These factors are called zero factors and perfect factors in the de Bruijn graph. We apply a folding technique to construct pseudo-random array codes and examine the minimum distance of the constructed codes. The folding is applied on sequences generated from irreducible polynomials or a product of irreducible polynomials with the same degree and the same exponent. Direct and recursive constructions for de Bruijn array codes are presented and discussed.

2023: On Hierarchies of Balanced Sequences
Abstract: Balanced sequences and balanced codes have attracted a lot of research in the last seventy years due to their diverse applications in information theory as well as other areas of computer science and engineering. There have been some methods to classify balanced sequences. This work suggests two new different hierarchies to classify these sequences. The first one is based on the largest <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\ell $ </tex-math></inline-formula> for which each <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\ell $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-tuple is contained the same amount of times in the sequence. This property is a generalization for the property required for de Bruijn sequences. The second hierarchy is based on the number of balanced derivatives of the sequence. Enumeration for each such family of sequences and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms are provided in this paper.

2023: Coding for IBLTs with Listing Guarantees
Abstract: The Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT) is a probabilistic data structure for set representation, with applications in network and traffic monitoring. It is known for its ability to list its elements, an operation that succeeds with high probability for sufficiently large table. However, listing can fail even for relatively small sets. This paper extends recent work on the worst-case analysis of IBLT, which guarantees successful listing for all sets of a certain size, by introducing more general IBLT schemes. These schemes allow for greater freedom in the implementation of the insert, delete, and listing operations and demonstrate that the IBLT memory can be reduced while still maintaining successful listing guarantees. The paper also explores the time-memory trade-off of these schemes, some of which are based on linear codes and Bh-sequences over finite fields.

2023: Graphs with the unique path property: Structure, cycles, factors, and constructions
Abstract: In a directed graph with the unique path property, there is a unique directed path of a given length n $n$ between any ordered pair of its t $t$ vertices. Such graphs, their paths, cycles, factors, and other properties, were extensively studied during the years, mainly in the context of de Bruijn graphs, forming the most important family of such graphs. Such a graph is equivalent to a t × t $t\times t$ binary matrix A $A$ for which A n = J ${A}^{n}=J$ , where J $J$ is the all‐ones t × t $t\times t$ matrix. In this paper, some new results on the structural properties of such graphs, which are not necessarily de Bruijn graphs, are proved. We mainly concentrate on such graphs for which each vertex has in‐degree two and out‐degree two. The minimum number and the maximum number of vertices which are reached from a given vertex using all paths of length smaller than n $n$ are considered. We provide an exact formula for the number of factors in these graphs and show that this number depends only on the number of alternating cycles in the graph, where in an alternating cycle every two consecutive edges have opposite directions in the cycle. Constructions of such graphs using several methods are presented. In particular, we present a new construction which provides a large set of such graphs with long alternating cycles. We define the integral graph and the derivative graph and implement these definitions on this family of graphs. Various properties from the point of view of the de Bruijn graph and the theory of nonsingular shift‐registers sequences are also considered. Finally, generalizations for graphs in which the in‐degree and the out‐degree of each vertex are greater than two are also discussed.

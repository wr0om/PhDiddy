2024: Beyond analytic bounds: Re-evaluating predictive power in risky decision models
Abstract: 
 Research in behavioral decision-making has produced many models of decision under risk. To improve our understanding of choice under risk, it is essential to perform rigorous model comparisons over large sets of decision settings to find which models are most useful. Recently, such large-scale comparisons have produced conflicting conclusions: A variant of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) was the best model in a study by He, Analytis, and Bhatia (2022), whereas variants of the model BEAST were the best in two choice prediction competitions. This study delves into these contradictions to identify and explore the underlying reasons. We replicate and extend the analysis by He et al., this time incorporating BEAST, which was previously excluded because it cannot be analytically estimated. Our results show that while CPT excels in systematically hand-crafted tasks, BEAST—originally designed for broader decision-making contexts—matches or even surpasses CPT’s performance when choice tasks are randomly selected, and predictions are made for new, unknown decision makers. This success of BEAST, very different from classical decision models—as it does not assume, for example, subjective transformations of outcomes and probabilities—puts into question previous conclusions concerning the underlying psychological mechanisms of choice under risk. Our results challenge the field to expand beyond established evaluating techniques and highlight the importance of an inclusive approach toward nonanalytic models, like BEAST, to achieve more objective insights into decision-making behavior.

2023: Towards Choice Engineering
Abstract: Effectively shaping human and animal behavior has been of great practical and theoretical importance for millennia. Here we ask whether quantitative models of choice can be used to achieve this goal more effectively than qualitative psychological principles. We term this approach, which is motivated by the effectiveness of engineering in the natural sciences, ‘choice engineering’. To address this question, we launched an academic competition, in which the academic participants were instructed to use either quantitative models or qualitative principles to design reward schedules that maximally bias choice in a repeated, two-alternative task. We found that a choice engineering approach was the most successful method for shaping behavior in our task. This is a proof of concept that quantitative models are ripe to be used in order to engineer behavior. Finally, we show that choice engineering can be effectively used to compare models in the cognitive sciences, thus providing an alternative to the standard statistical methods of model comparison that are based on likelihood or explained variance.

2022: Motivational drivers for serial position effects: Evidence from high-stakes legal decisions.
Abstract: Experts and employees in many domains make multiple similar but independent decisions in sequence. Often, the serial position of the case in the sequence influences the decision. Explanations for these serial position effects focus on the role of decision-makers' fatigue, but these effects emerge also when fatigue is unlikely. Here, we suggest that serial position effects can emerge due to decision-makers' motivation to be or appear consistent. For example, to avoid having inconsistencies revealed, decisions may become more favorable toward the side that is more likely to put a decision under scrutiny. As a context, we focus on the legal domain in which many high-stakes decisions are made in sequence and in which there are clear institutional processes of decision scrutiny. We analyze two field data sets: 386,109 U.S. immigration judges' decisions on asylum requests and 20,796 jury decisions in 18th century London criminal court. We distinguish between five mechanisms that can drive serial position effects and examine their predictions in these settings. We find that consistent with motivation-based explanations of serial position effects, but inconsistent with fatigue-based explanations, decisions become more lenient as a function of serial position, and the effect persists over breaks. We further find, as is predicted by motivational accounts, that the leniency effect is stronger among more experienced decision-makers. By elucidating the different drivers of serial position effects, our investigation clarifies why they are common, when they are expected, and how to reduce them.

2021: Contradictory Deviations from Maximization: Environment-Specific Biases, or Reflections of Basic Properties of Human Learning?
Abstract: Analyses of human reaction to economic incentives reveal contradictory deviations from maximization. For example, underinvestment in the stock market suggests risk aversion, but insufficient diversification of financial assets suggests risk-seeking. Leading explanations for these contradictions assume that different choice environments (e.g., different framings) trigger different biases. Our analysis shows that variation in the choice environment is not a necessary condition. It demonstrates how certain changes in the incentive structure are sufficient to trigger six pairs of contradictory deviations from maximization even when the choice environment is fixed. Moreover, our analysis shows that the direction of these deviations can be captured by assuming that choice propensities reflect reliance on small samples of past experiences. In order to clarify the underlying processes, we considered distinct models of the reliance on small samples assumption, and compared them to classical models of choice (including prospect theory). The comparison focused on both within-individual, and between-group predictions (based on a preregistered study with 120 new tasks). The results reveal large advantage of "wide sampling" models that (in the static settings we examine) approximate an effort to rely on the most similar past experiences. Surprisingly, we also found that assuming that the parameters reflect stable individual traits impairs predictions; it seems that the number of "most similar past experiences" for each individual varies from task to task. These results suggest that ignoring the predictable impact of the incentive structure can lead to exaggeration of the importance of environment- and individual-specific decision biases.

2021: Enforcement policies: Frequency of inspection is more important than the severity of punishment
Abstract: External enforcement policies aimed to reduce violations differ on two key components: the probability of inspection and the severity of punishments. Different lines of research offer competing predictions regarding the relative importance of each component. In three incentive compatible studies, students and Prolific crowdsourcing participants (Ntotal=430) repeatedly faced temptations to commit violations under two enforcement policies. Controlling for expected value, the results indicated that a policy combining High probability of Inspection with Low Severity of fine (HILS) was more effective than a policy combining Low probability of Inspection with High Severity of fine (LIHS). Consistent with the prediction of Decisions from Experience research, this finding held even when the severity of the fine was stated in advance to boost deterrence. In addition, the advantage of HILS over LIHS was greater as participants’ baseline rate of violation (without enforcement) was higher, implying that HILS is more effective among frequent offenders.

2021: Frequency of enforcement is more important than the severity of punishment in reducing violation behaviors
Abstract: Significance Ramifications of seemingly small violations, such as not adhering to COVID-19 regulations, accumulate fast with dire social consequences. The high costs of close monitoring and severe sanctions often lead policymakers to prioritize either the probability of inspection or the severity of punishments. Using common one-shot, descriptive settings, findings from experimental economics support the superiority of severe punishments, whereas findings from behavioral ethics highlight the role of internal rather than external enforcement. However, these settings are estranged from real-life environments in which learning about the external enforcement policy naturally occurs via repeated experience. Using a more ecologically valid, experience-based setting, we found robust evidence for the greater effectiveness of frequent small punishments over rare severe punishments in reducing violations. External enforcement policies aimed to reduce violations differ on two key components: the probability of inspection and the severity of the punishment. Different lines of research offer different insights regarding the relative importance of each component. In four studies, students and Prolific crowdsourcing participants (Ntotal = 816) repeatedly faced temptations to commit violations under two enforcement policies. Controlling for expected value, we found that a policy combining a high probability of inspection with a low severity of fines (HILS) was more effective than an economically equivalent policy that combined a low probability of inspection with a high severity of fines (LIHS). The advantage of prioritizing inspection frequency over punishment severity (HILS over LIHS) was greater for participants who, in the absence of enforcement, started out with a higher violation rate. Consistent with studies of decisions from experience, frequent enforcement with small fines was more effective than rare severe fines even when we announced the severity of the fine in advance to boost deterrence. In addition, in line with the phenomenon of underweighting of rare events, the effect was stronger when the probability of inspection was rarer (as in most real-life inspection probabilities) and was eliminated under moderate inspection probabilities. We thus recommend that policymakers looking to effectively reduce recurring violations among noncriminal populations should consider increasing inspection rates rather than punishment severity.

2021: Prediction oriented behavioral research and its relationship to classical decision research
Abstract: This paper argues that two of the common methods used in behavioral and social sciences to reduce the chances that models overfit the available data, namely heavy reliance on benchmark models and rigorous parameter estimation techniques, can slow the advancement of these sciences. An examination of classical decision research highlights how applying these methods shaped the field but have also led to limited success. As an alternative, the paper proposes a prediction-oriented approach to the development of behavioral models. Evaluating and comparing models based on their predictive power inherently guards against overfitting and also facilitates accumulation of knowledge. The paper reviews research employing the prediction-oriented approach in behavioral decision research and demonstrates that, in contrast to a common misconception, the focus on predictions can also facilitate better understanding of the underlying processes.

2020: On the Value of Alert Systems and Gentle Rule Enforcement in Addressing Pandemics
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to policy makers on how to encourage compliance to social distancing and personal protection rules. This paper compares the effectiveness of two policies that aim to increase the frequency of responsible health behavior using smartphone-tracking applications. The first involves enhanced alert capabilities, which remove social externalities and protect the users from others’ reckless behavior. The second adds a rule enforcement mechanism that reduces the users’ benefit from reckless behavior. Both strategies should be effective if agents are expected-value maximizers, risk averse, and behave in accordance with cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) or in accordance with the Cognitive Hierarchy model (Camerer et al., 2004). A multi-player trust-game experiment was designed to compare the effectiveness of the two policies. The results reveal a substantial advantage to the enforcement application, even one with occasional misses. The enhanced-alert strategy was completely ineffective. The findings align with the small samples hypothesis, suggesting that decision makers tend to select the options that lead to the best payoff in a small sample of similar past experiences. In the current context, the tendency to rely on a small sample appears to be more consequential than other deviations from rational choice.

2020: The influence of biased exposure to forgone outcomes
Abstract: Funding information I-CORE program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1821/12 Abstract After making decisions, we often get feedback concerning forgone outcomes (what would have happened had we chosen differently). Yet, many times, our exposure to such feedback is systematically biased. For example, your friends are more likely to tell you about a party you missed if it was fun than if it was boring. Despite its prevalence, the effects of biased exposure to forgone outcomes on future choice have not been directly studied. In three studies (five experiments) using a simplified learning task, we study the basic influence of biased exposure to forgone outcomes in the extreme case in which decision makers can easily infer the missing information such that the biased exposure carries almost no informational value. The results in all studies suggest that nevertheless, the biased exposure to forgone outcomes affected choice. Exposure to forgone outcomes only when they were better than the obtained outcomes (Only-Better-Forgone) increased selections of the forgone option compared with exposure to forgone outcomes only when they were worse than the obtained outcome (Only-Worse-Forgone). Moreover, relative to an unbiased exposure to all forgone outcomes, the effect of exposure to Only-Worse-Forgone was larger than the effect of exposure to Only-Better-Forgone feedback. However, these effects were not universal: In environments that include rare negative events (“disasters”), biased exposure to forgone outcomes had very little effect. We raise potential explanations and further discuss implications for marketing and risk awareness.

2020: Best to Be Last: Serial Position Effects in Legal Decisions in the Field and in the Lab
Abstract: Experts in many domains, from education and finances to sports and entertainment, make multiple similar but independent decisions in sequence. Does the mere serial position of a case in a sequence influence the decision? We focus on the legal domain in which many high-stakes decisions are made in a sequence and justice considerations imply irrelevant factors like serial position of a case must not impact decision making. We identify four mechanisms that can drive serial position effects and note each can have different predictions, hence existence and direction of such effects are empirical questions. Indeed, most empirical evidence from non-legal settings suggests decisions become more favorable with serial position, but a previous study of sequences of parole hearings finds the opposite effect. We analyze two field datasets, 386,109 US immigration judges’ decisions on asylum requests and 20,796 jury decisions in 18th century London criminal court, and find decisions become more favorable (lenient) the later a decision is made in a sequence of decisions. To complement the analysis, we run three controlled experiments with laypeople and find similar results. We conclude that while serial position effects may be context-specific, from the point of view of the individual involved, it is often best to be last.

2020: Underweighting of rare events in social interactions and its implications to the design of voluntary health applications
Abstract: Research on small decisions from experience suggests that people often behave as if they underweight rare events and choose the options that are frequently better. In a pandemic, this tendency implies complacency and reckless behavior. Furthermore, behavioral contagion exacerbates this problem. In two pre-registered experiments (Ntotal = 312), we validate these predictions and highlight a potential solution. Groups of participants played a repeated social game in one of two versions. In the basic version, people clearly preferred the dangerous reckless behavior that was better most of the time over the safer responsible behavior. In the augmented version, we gave participants an additional alternative abstracting the use of an application that frequently saves time but can sometimes have high costs. This alternative was stochastically dominated by the option abstracting the responsible choice and was thus normatively “irrelevant” to the decision participants made. Nevertheless, most people chose the new (“irrelevant”) alternative, providing the first clear demonstration of underweighting of rare events in fully described social games. We discuss public policies that can make the responsible use of health applications better most of the time, thus helping them get traction despite being voluntary. In one field demonstration of this idea amid the COVID-19 pandemic, usage rates of a contact tracing application among nursing home employees more than tripled when using the app also started saving them little time on a daily basis, and the high usage rates sustained over at least four weeks.

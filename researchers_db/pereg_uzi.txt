2025: The Multiple-Access Channel With Entangled Transmitters
Abstract: Communication over a classical multiple-access channel (MAC) with entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share entanglement resources a priori before communication begins. Leditzky et al. (2020) presented an example of a classical MAC, defined in terms of a pseudo telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links. Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.

2024: Entanglement Coordination Rates in Multi-User Networks
Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-user quantum networks, thus char-acterizing the minimal resources for simulating a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.

2024: Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.

2024: Semantic Security with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance: Interception and Loss
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.

2024: Secure Communication with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance
Abstract: Secure communication is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, where the adversary may intercept the legitimate receiver's entanglement resource before communication takes place. The communication setting of unreliable assistance, without security aspects, was originally motivated by the extreme photon loss in practical communication systems. The operational principle is to adapt the transmission rate to the availability of entanglement assistance, without resorting to feedback and repetition. Here, we require secrecy as well. An achievable secrecy rate region is derived for general quantum wiretap channels, and a multi-letter secrecy capacity formula for the special class of degraded channels.

2024: Coordination Capacity for Classical-Quantum Correlations
Abstract: Network coordination is considered in three basic settings, characterizing the generation of separable and classicalquantum correlations among multiple parties. First, we consider the simulation of a classical-quantum state between two nodes with rate-limited common randomness (CR) and communication. Furthermore, we study the preparation of a separable state between multiple nodes with rate-limited CR and no communication. At last, we consider a broadcast setting, where a sender and two receivers simulate a classical-quantum-quantum state using rate-limited CR and communication. We establish the optimal tradeoff between communication and CR rates in each setting.

2024: Deterministic K-Identification for MC Poisson Channel With Inter-Symbol Interference
Abstract: Various applications of molecular communications (MCs) feature an alarm-prompt behavior for which the prevalent Shannon capacity may not be the appropriate performance metric. The identification capacity as an alternative measure for such systems has been motivated and established in the literature. In this paper, we study deterministic K-identification (DKI) for the discrete-time <italic>Poisson</italic> channel (DTPC) with inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the transmitter is restricted to an average and a peak molecule release rate constraint. Such a channel serves as a model for diffusive MC systems featuring long channel impulse responses and employing molecule-counting receivers. We derive lower and upper bounds on the DKI capacity of the DTPC with ISI when the size of the target message set <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the number of ISI channel taps <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$L$ </tex-math></inline-formula> may grow with the codeword length <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. As a key finding, we establish that for deterministic encoding, assuming that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$L$ </tex-math></inline-formula> both grow sub-linearly in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, i.e., <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$K = 2^{\kappa \log n}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$L = 2^{l \log n} $ </tex-math></inline-formula> with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\kappa + 4l \in [0,1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\kappa \in [0,1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the identification target rate and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$l \in [0,1/4) $ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the ISI rate, then the number of different messages that can be reliably identified scales super-exponentially in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, i.e., <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sim 2^{(n\log n)R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$R$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the DKI coding rate. Moreover, since <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$l$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\kappa $ </tex-math></inline-formula> must fulfill <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\kappa + 4l \in [0,1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, we show that optimizing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$l$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (or equivalently the symbol rate) leads to an effective identification rate [bits/s] that scales sub-linearly with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n $ </tex-math></inline-formula>. This result is in contrast to the typical transmission rate [bits/s] which is independent of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>.

2024: Quantum Relay Channels
Abstract: Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial-decode forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial-decode forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.

2023: The Multiple-Access Channel with Entangled Transmitters
Abstract: Communication over a classical multiple-access channel (MAC) with quantum entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share entanglement resources a priori. Leditzky et al. (2020) presented an example, defined in terms of a pseudo telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given entanglement resources, the regions coincide.

2023: The Multiple- Access Channel with Entangled and Conferencing Transmitters
Abstract: Communication over a multiple-access channel (MAC) with entanglement assisted and conferencing transmitters is considered, where the transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links. We fully characterize the capacity region for the MAC with entangled transmitters and classical conferencing. We also introduce a quantum conferencing protocol. For the MAC with entangled transmitters and quantum conferencing, we determine a achievable region. This region is generally larger than the capacity region for the MAC with entangled transmitters and classical conferencing. Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate. We continue to discuss potential applications of cooperation between the transmitters for the future 6G system. This is only a short abstract. The long version with all proofs can be found on arxiv [l ],

2023: Entanglement-Assisted Covert Communication via Qubit Depolarizing Channels
Abstract: We consider entanglement-assisted communication over the qubit depolarizing channel under the security requirement of covert communication, where not only the information is kept secret, but the transmission itself must be concealed from detection by an adversary. Previous work showed that $O(\sqrt n )$ information bits can be reliably and covertly transmitted in n channel uses without entanglement assistance. However, Gagatsos et al. (2020) showed that entanglement assistance can increase this scaling to $O(\sqrt n \log n)$ for continuous-variable bosonic channels. Here, we present a finite-dimensional parallel, and show that $O(\sqrt n \log n)$ covert bits can be transmitted reliably over n uses of a qubit depolarizing channel.

2023: Communication Over Entanglement-Breaking Channels With Unreliable Entanglement Assistance
Abstract: Entanglement assistance can improve communication rates significantly. Yet, its generation is susceptible to failure. The unreliable assistance model accounts for those challenges. Previous work provided an asymptotic formula that outlines the tradeoff between the unassisted and excess rates from entanglement assistance. We derive a full characterization for entanglement-breaking channels, and show that combining entanglement-assisted and unassisted coding is suboptimal. From a networking perspective, this finding is nontrivial and highlights a quantum behavior arising from superposition.

2023: Capacity Bounds for Identification With Effective Secrecy
Abstract: An upper bound to the identification capacity of discrete memoryless wiretap channels is derived under the requirement of semantic effective secrecy, combining semantic secrecy and stealth constraints. A previously established lower bound is improved by applying it to a prefix channel, formed by concatenating an auxiliary channel and the actual channel. The bounds are tight if the legitimate channel is more capable than the eavesdropper’s channel. An illustrative example is provided for a wiretap channel that is composed of a point-to-point channel, and a parallel, reversely degraded wiretap channel. A comparison with results for message transmission and for identification with only secrecy constraint is provided.

2023: Increasing Quantum Communication Rates Using Hyperentangled Photonic States
Abstract: Quantum communication is based on the generation of quantum states and exploitation of quantum resources for communication protocols. Currently, photons are considered as the optimal carrier of information, because they enable long-distance transition with resilience to decoherence, and they are relatively easy to create and detect. Entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum communication and information processing, and it is of particular importance for quantum repeaters [1]. Hyperentanglement [2], a state where parties are entangled with two or more degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides an important additional resource because it increases data rates and enhances error resilience. However, in photonics, the channel capacity, i.e. the ultimate throughput, is fundamentally limited when dealing with linear elements. We propose a technique for achieving higher transmission rates for quantum communication by using hyperentangled states, based on multiplexing multiple DoFs on a single photon, transmitting the photon, and eventually demultiplexing the DoFs to different photons at the destination, using a Bell state measurement. Following our scheme, one can generate two entangled qubit pairs by sending only a single photon. The proposed transmission scheme lays the groundwork for novel quantum communication protocols with higher transmission rate and refined control over scalable quantum technologies.

2022: The Quantum MAC with Cribbing Encoders
Abstract: Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2’s cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input, and a partial decode-forward region for non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum (c-q) MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing.

2022: Identification over quantum broadcast channels
Abstract: None

2022: Communication with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance
Abstract: Entanglement resources can increase transmission rates substantially. Unfortunately, entanglement is a fragile resource that is quickly degraded by decoherence effects. The present work introduces a new model of unreliable entanglement assistance, whereby the communication system operates whether entanglement assistance is present or not. While the sender is ignorant, the receiver knows whether the entanglement generation was successful. In the case of a failure, the receiver decodes less information. In this manner, the effective transmission rate is adapted according to the assistance status. Regularized formulas are derived for the classical and quantum capacity regions with unreliable entanglement assistance, characterizing the tradeoff between the unassisted rate and the excess rate that can be obtained from entanglement assistance.

2022: Deterministic Identification for Molecular Communications Over the Poisson Channel
Abstract: Various applications of molecular communications (MC) are event-triggered, and, as a consequence, the prevalent Shannon capacity may not be the right measure for performance assessment. Thus, in this paper, we motivate and establish the identification capacity as an alternative metric. In particular, we study deterministic identification (DI) for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC), subject to an average and a peak molecule release rate constraint, which serves as a model for MC systems employing molecule counting receivers. It is established that the number of different messages that can be reliably identified for this channel scales as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$2^{(n\log n)R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${n}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> are the codeword length and coding rate, respectively. Lower and upper bounds on the DI capacity of the DTPC are developed. The obtained large capacity of the DI channel sheds light on the performance of natural DI systems such as natural olfaction, which are known for their extremely large chemical discriminatory power in biology. Furthermore, numerical results for the empirical miss-identification and false identification error rates are provided for finite length codes. This allows us to characterize the behaviour of the error rate for increasing codeword lengths, which complements our theoretically-derived scale for asymptotically large codeword lengths.

2022: Identification over Compound MIMO Broadcast Channels
Abstract: The identification (ID) capacity region of the compound broadcast channel is determined under an average error criterion, where the sender has no channel state information. We give single-letter ID capacity formulas for discrete channels and MIMO Gaussian channels, under an average input constraint. The capacity theorems apply to general broadcast channels. This is in contrast to the transmission setting, where the capacity is only known for special cases, notably the degraded broadcast channel and the MIMO broadcast channel with private messages. Furthermore, the ID capacity region of the compound MIMO broadcast channel is in general larger than the transmission capacity region. This is a departure from the single-user behavior of ID, since the ID capacity of a single-user channel equals the transmission capacity.

2022: Deterministic Identification for MC ISI-Poisson Channel
Abstract: Several applications of molecular communications (MC) feature an alarm-prompt behavior for which the prevalent Shannon capacity may not be the appropriate performance metric. The identification capacity as an alternative measure for such systems has been motivated and established in the literature. In this paper, we study deterministic identification (DI) for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) with intersymbol interference (ISI) where the transmitter is restricted to an average and a peak molecule release rate constraint. Such a channel serves as a model for diffusive MC systems featuring long channel impulse responses and employing molecule counting receivers. We derive lower and upper bounds on the DI capacity of the DTPC with ISI when the number of ISI channel taps $K$ may grow with the codeword length $n$ (e.g., due to increasing symbol rate). As a key finding, we establish that for deterministic encoding, the codebook size scales as $2^{(n\log n)R}$ assuming that the number of ISI channel taps scales as $K=2^{\kappa\log n}$, where $R$ is the coding rate and $\kappa$ is the ISI rate. Moreover, we show that optimizing $\kappa$ leads to an effective identification rate [bits/s] that scales linearly with $n$, which is in contrast to the typical transmission rate [bits/s] that is independent of $n$.

2020: Permutation orbifolds of 𝔰𝔩2 vertex operator algebras
Abstract: We analyze two types of permutation orbifolds: (i) S2-orbifolds of the universal level k vertex operator algebra Vk(𝔰𝔩2) and of its simple quotient Lk(𝔰𝔩2), and (ii) the S3-orbifold of the level one simple vertex operator algebra L1(𝔰𝔩2). We determine their structures and discuss related W-algebras.

2020: PERMUTATION ORBIFOLDS OF sl2 VERTEX OPERATOR ALGEBRAS
Abstract: We analyze two types of permutation orbifolds: (i) S2orbifolds of the universal level k vertex operator algebra V (sl2) and of its simple quotient Lk(sl2), and (ii) the S3-orbifold of the level one simple vertex operator algebra L1(sl2). We determine their structures and discuss related W -algebras.

2025: Estimation Error: Distribution and Pointwise Limits
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the distribution and convergence properties of the estimation error $W = X - \hat{X}(Y)$, where $\hat{X}(Y)$ is the Bayesian estimator of a random variable $X$ from a noisy observation $Y = X +\sigma Z$ where $\sigma$ is the parameter indicating the strength of noise $Z$. Using the conditional expectation framework (that is, $\hat{X}(Y)$ is the conditional mean), we define the normalized error $\mathcal{E}_\sigma = \frac{W}{\sigma}$ and explore its properties. Specifically, in the first part of the paper, we characterize the probability density function of $W$ and $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$. Along the way, we also find conditions for the existence of the inverse functions for the conditional expectations. In the second part, we study pointwise (i.e., almost sure) convergence of $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$ under various assumptions about the noise and the underlying distributions. Our results extend some of the previous limits of $\mathcal{E}_\sigma$ studied under the $L^2$ convergence, known as the \emph{mmse dimension}, to the pointwise case.

2025: Generalization and Informativeness of Weighted Conformal Risk Control Under Covariate Shift
Abstract: Predictive models are often required to produce reliable predictions under statistical conditions that are not matched to the training data. A common type of training-testing mismatch is covariate shift, where the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input features remains fixed, while the marginal distribution of the inputs changes. Weighted conformal risk control (W-CRC) uses data collected during the training phase to convert point predictions into prediction sets with valid risk guarantees at test time despite the presence of a covariate shift. However, while W-CRC provides statistical reliability, its efficiency -- measured by the size of the prediction sets -- can only be assessed at test time. In this work, we relate the generalization properties of the base predictor to the efficiency of W-CRC under covariate shifts. Specifically, we derive a bound on the inefficiency of the W-CRC predictor that depends on algorithmic hyperparameters and task-specific quantities available at training time. This bound offers insights on relationships between the informativeness of the prediction sets, the extent of the covariate shift, and the size of the calibration and training sets. Experiments on fingerprinting-based localization validate the theoretical results.

2025: An Analytical Study of the Min-Sum Approximation for Polar Codes
Abstract: The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes. Although it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in practice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common case of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using successive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions, we show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly calculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time $O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code construction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we develop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\mathrm{L}} = R_{\mathrm{L}}(\lambda)$ and $R_{\mathrm{U}} =R_{\mathrm{U}}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the labeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0<\beta<\frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R<R_{\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of polar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and their error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\beta}$. That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that $0<R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.

2025: On entropy-constrained Gaussian channel capacity via the moment problem
Abstract: We study the capacity of the power-constrained additive Gaussian channel with an entropy constraint at the input. In particular, we characterize this capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, as a corollary of the following general result on a moment matching problem: we show that for any continuous random variable with finite moments, the largest number of initial moments that can be matched by a discrete random variable of sufficiently small but positive entropy is three.

2024: Cell-Free MIMO Perceptive Mobile Networks: Cloud vs. Edge Processing
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks implement sensing and communication by reusing existing cellular infrastructure. Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, thanks to the cooperation among distributed access points, supports the deployment of multistatic radar sensing, while providing high spectral efficiency for data communication services. To this end, the distributed access points communicate over fronthaul links with a central processing unit acting as a cloud processor. This work explores four different types of PMN uplink solutions based on Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, in which the sensing and decoding functionalities are carried out at either cloud or edge. Accordingly, we investigate and compare joint cloud-based decoding and sensing (CDCS), hybrid cloud-based decoding and edge-based sensing (CDES), hybrid edge-based decoding and cloud-based sensing (EDCS) and edge-based decoding and sensing (EDES). In all cases, we target a unified design problem formulation whereby the fronthaul quantization of signals received in the training and data phases are jointly designed to maximize the achievable rate under sensing requirements and fronthaul capacity constraints. Via numerical results, the four implementation scenarios are compared as a function of the available fronthaul resources by highlighting the relative merits of edge- and cloud-based sensing and communications. This study provides guidelines on the optimal functional allocation in fronthaul-constrained networks implementing integrated sensing and communications.

2024: An Achievable Scheme for Channels with an Amplitude Constraint Using Walsh Functions
Abstract: Handling peak-to-average power ratio is a major challenge in the design of communications systems, as current signal designs constrain the power of the generated signal and therefore its peak amplitude is considered as an uncontrolled outcome of the power-constrained signal generation scheme. An alternative signal design approach would be to restrict the peak of the signal's amplitude. The capacity of continuous-time bandlimited linear channels with additive Gaussian noise and peak input amplitude constraint is unknown to date; however, if the channel impulse response has finite energy, then any rate achieved by peak-amplitude constrained waveforms can be achieved by binary waveforms (unit processes). This fact is the basis for the two major previous works that have derived lower bounds on the achievable rate of this channel for the ideal bandlimited case. In this work we propose a different approach for obtaining lower bounds on the capacity of this channel, particularly relevant for linear, time-invariant channels with non-ideal frequency responses. Our approach is based on modulating a subset of the Walsh basis functions and using a fundamental relationship between the peak amplitude and the power of such signals. This approach yields achievable rates for general linear channels.

2024: Cross-Validation Conformal Risk Control
Abstract: Conformal risk control (CRC) is a recently proposed technique that applies post-hoc to a conventional point predictor to provide calibration guarantees. Generalizing conformal prediction (CP), with CRC, calibration is ensured for a set predictor that is extracted from the point predictor to control a risk function such as the probability of miscoverage or the false negative rate. The original CRC requires the available data set to be split between training and validation data sets. This can be problematic when data availability is limited, resulting in inefficient set predictors. In this paper, a novel CRC method is introduced that is based on cross-validation, rather than on validation as the original CRC. The proposed cross-validation CRC (CV-CRC) extends a version of the jackknife-minmax from CP to CRC, allowing for the control of a broader range of risk functions. CV-CRC is proved to offer theoretical guarantees on the average risk of the set predictor. Furthermore, numerical experiments show that CV-CRC can reduce the average set size with respect to CRC when the available data are limited.

2024: Lower Bounds on Mutual Information for Linear Codes Transmitted over Binary Input Channels, and for Information Combining
Abstract: It has been known for a long time that the mutual information between the input sequence and output sequence of a binary symmetric channel (BSC) is upper bounded by the mutual information between the same input sequence and the output sequence of a binary erasure channel (BEC) with the same capacity. Recently, Samorodnitsky discovered that one may also lower bound the BSC mutual information in terms of the mutual information between the same input sequence and a more capable BEC. In this paper, we strengthen Samorodnitsky's bound for the special case where the input to the channel is distributed uniformly over a linear code. Furthermore, for a general (not necessarily binary) input distribution $P_{X}$ and channel $W_{Y\vert X}$, we derive a new lower bound on the mutual information $I(X;Y^{n})$ for $n$ transmissions of $X\sim P_{X}$ through the channel $W_{Y\vert X}$.

2024: Accelerating Multi-UAV Collaborative Sensing Data Collection: A Hybrid TDMA-NOMA-Cooperative Transmission in Cell-Free MIMO Networks
Abstract: This work investigates a collaborative sensing and data collection system in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) sense an area of interest and transmit images to a cloud server (CS) for processing. To accelerate the completion of sensing missions, including data transmission, the sensing task is divided into individual private sensing tasks for each UAV and a common sensing task that is executed by all UAVs to enable cooperative transmission. Unlike existing studies, we explore the use of an advanced cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, which effectively manages inter-UAV interference. To further optimize wireless channel utilization, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy that combines time-division multiple access (TDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and cooperative transmission. The problem of jointly optimizing task splitting ratios and the hybrid TDMA-NOMA-cooperative transmission strategy is formulated with the objective of minimizing mission completion time. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation and hybrid transmission scheme in accelerating the completion of sensing missions.

2024: Gaussian Primitive Diamond Channel: Correlated Noise at Relays and Relevant Applications
Abstract: We investigate the special case of a symmetric Gaussian primitive diamond relay channel comprising a correlated Gaussian noise channel, and fronthaul links with limited rate from the relays to the destination. We use a combination of oblivious compress and forward (CF) with distributed Wyner-Ziv compression, and decode and forward (DF) techniques, where each relay decodes the whole message and sends half of its bits to the destination. We derive the CF achievable rate and investigate the effect of positive noise correlation on the system performance. The optimal time-sharing proportion between CF and DF is calculated for positive noise correlation.

2024: A Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach to Integrated Sensing and Communication
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a point-to-point integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a transmitter conveys a message to a receiver over a channel with memory and simultaneously estimates the state of the channel through the backscattered signals from the emitted waveform. Using Massey's concept of directed information for channels with memory, we formulate the capacity-distortion tradeoff for the ISAC problem when sensing is performed in an online fashion. Optimizing the transmit waveform for this system to simultaneously achieve good communication and sensing performance is a complicated task, and thus we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to find a solution. The proposed approach enables the agent to optimize the ISAC performance by learning a reward that reflects the difference between the communication gain and the sensing loss. Since the state-space in our RL model is \`a priori unbounded, we employ deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). Our numerical results suggest a significant performance improvement when one considers unbounded state-space as opposed to a simpler RL problem with reduced state-space. In the extreme case of degenerate state-space only memoryless signaling strategies are possible. Our results thus emphasize the necessity of well exploiting the memory inherent in ISAC systems.

2024: Successive Refinement in Large-Scale Computation: Advancing Model Inference Applications
Abstract: Modern computationally-intensive applications often operate under time constraints, necessitating acceleration methods and distribution of computational workloads across multiple entities. However, the outcome is either achieved within the desired timeline or not, and in the latter case, valuable resources are wasted. In this paper, we introduce solutions for layered-resolution computation. These solutions allow lower-resolution results to be obtained at an earlier stage than the final result. This innovation notably enhances the deadline-based systems, as if a computational job is terminated due to time constraints, an approximate version of the final result can still be generated. Moreover, in certain operational regimes, a high-resolution result might be unnecessary, because the low-resolution result may already deviate significantly from the decision threshold, for example in AI-based decision-making systems. Therefore, operators can decide whether higher resolution is needed or not based on intermediate results, enabling computations with adaptive resolution. We present our framework for two critical and computationally demanding jobs: distributed matrix multiplication (linear) and model inference in machine learning (nonlinear). Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the execution delay for the first resolution is significantly shorter than that for the final resolution, while maintaining overall complexity comparable to the conventional one-shot approach. Our experiments further illustrate how the layering feature increases the likelihood of meeting deadlines and enables adaptability and transparency in massive, large-scale computations.

2024: On the Capacity of the Peak-Limited and Band-Limited Channel
Abstract: We investigate the peak-power limited (PPL) Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels in which the signal is band-limited, and its instantaneous power cannot exceed the power P. This model is relevant to many communication systems; however, its capacity is still unknown. We use a new geometry-based approach which evaluates the maximal entropy of the transmitted signal by assessing the volume of the body, in the space of Nyquist-rate samples, comprising all the points the transmitted signal can reach. This leads to lower bounds on capacity which are tight at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs). We find lower bounds on capacity, expressed as power efficiency, that were higher than the known ones by a factor of 3.3 and 8.6 in the low-pass and the band-pass cases, respectively. The gap to the upper bounds is reduced to a power ratio of 1.5. The new bounds are numerically evaluated for FDMA-style signals with limited duration and also are derived in the general case as a conjecture. The penalty in power efficiency due to the peak power constraint is roughly 6 dB at high SNRs. Further research is needed to develop effective modulation and coding for this channel.

2024: Improved Bounds on the Number of Support Points of the Capacity-Achieving Input for Amplitude Constrained Poisson Channels
Abstract: This work considers a discrete-time Poisson noise channel with an input amplitude constraint A and a dark current parameter A. It is known that the capacity-achieving distribution for this channel is discrete with finitely many points. Recently, for $A$ = 0, a lower bound of order ✓A and an upper bound of order A log2 (A) have been demonstrated on the cardinality of the support of the optimal input distribution. In this work, we improve these results in several ways. First, we provide upper and lower bounds that hold for non-zero dark current. Second, we produce a sharper upper bound with a far simpler technique. In particular, for $A$ = 0, we sharpen the upper bound from the order of A log2 (A) to the order of A. Finally, some other additional information about the location of the support is provided.

2024: Achieving Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channel Capacity with Scalar Lattices
Abstract: A coding scheme with scalar lattices is applied to K-receiver, Gaussian, vector broadcast channels with K independent messages, one for each receiver. The method decomposes each receiver channel into parallel scalar channels with known interference and applies dirty paper coding with a modulo interval, amplitude shift keying (ASK), and probabilistic shaping to each scalar channel. The achievable rate tuples include all points inside the capacity region by choosing truncated Gaussian shaping, large ASK alphabets, and large modulo intervals.

2024: Geometrical Bounds on the Capacity of the Binary Bipolar Input AWGN Channel
Abstract: We study power-effective communication systems over band-limited Additive White Gaussian Noise channels in which the transmitter's output is constrained to be symmetric binary (bipolar) or peak-limited. New geometrical analysis is introduced, and the admissible band-limited signals are shown to form a convex set. We improved the previous upper and lower bounds on capacity, the gap between the upper and lower bounds on capacity at high SNR is reduced to 1.7dB. New attributes of the optimal signals are derived, mainly the central role of binary signals with sign transition rate not exceeding the Nyquist rate of the channel. The results rely on an extensive numerical evaluation and would benefit from further analytical progress.

2024: Integrated Sensing and Communication in the Finite Blocklength Regime
Abstract: A point-to-point integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is considered where a transmitter conveys a message to a receiver over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) and simultaneously estimates the state of the channel through the backscattered signals of the emitted waveform. We derive achievability and converse bounds on the rate-distortion-error tradeoff in the finite blocklength regime, and also characterize the second-order rate-distortion-error region for the proposed setup. Numerical analysis shows that our proposed joint ISAC scheme significantly outperforms traditional time-sharing based schemes where the available resources are split between the sensing and communication tasks.

2024: Wetting Transition on Trees I: Percolation With Clustering
Abstract: A new ``Percolation with Clustering'' (PWC) model is introduced, where (the probabilities of) site percolation configurations on the leaf set of a binary tree are rewarded exponentially according to a generic function, which measures the degree of clustering in the configuration. Conditions on such ``clustering function'' are given for the existence of a limiting free energy and a wetting transition, namely the existence of a non-trivial percolation parameter threshold above and only above which the set of ``dry'' (open) sites have an asymptotic density. Several examples of clustering functions are given and studied using the general theory. The results here will be used in a sequel paper to study the wetting transition for the discrete Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall constraint.

2024: Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall II: Asymptotics
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two works which study the discrete Gaussian free field on the binary tree when all leaves are conditioned to be positive. In the first work ("Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall I: Bounds") we identified the repulsion profile followed by the field in order to fulfill this"hard-wall constraint"event. In this work, we use these findings to obtain a comprehensive, sharp asymptotic description of the law of the field under this conditioning. We provide asymptotics for both local statistics, namely the (conditional) law of the field in a neighborhood of a vertex, as well as global statistics, including the (conditional) law of the minimum, maximum, empirical population mean and all subcritical exponential martingales. We conclude that the laws of the conditional and unconditional fields are asymptotically mutually singular with respect to each other.

2024: On support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity
Abstract: We study fractal properties of support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity (cLQG) associated with the Gaussian Free Field in planar domains. Specifically, we completely characterize the gauge functions $\phi$ (subject to mild monotonicity conditions) for which the cLQG admits a support set of finite $\phi$-Hausdorff measure. As a corollary, we settle the conjecture that the cLQG is supported on a set of vanishing Hausdorff dimension. Our proofs are based on the fact that the cLQG describes the near-critical level sets of Discrete Gaussian Free Field.

2024: Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall I: Bounds
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two works which study the discrete Gaussian free field on the binary tree when all leaves are conditioned to be positive. In this work, we obtain sharp asymptotics for the probability of this"hard-wall constraint"event, and identify the repulsion profile followed by the field in order to achieve it. We also provide estimates for the mean, fluctuations and covariances of the field under the conditioning, which show that in the first log-many generations the field is localized around its mean. These results are used in the sequel work ("Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall II: Asymptotics") to obtain a comprehensive asymptotic description of the law of the field under the conditioning.

2024: Tightness for the Cover Time of Wired Planar Domains
Abstract: We consider a continuous time simple random walk on a subset of the square lattice with wired boundary conditions: the walk transitions at unit edge rate on the graph obtained from the lattice closure of the subset by contracting the boundary into one vertex. We study the cover time of such walk, namely the time it takes for the walk to visit all vertices in the graph. Taking a sequence of subsets obtained as scaled lattice versions of a nice planar domain, we show that the square root of the cover time normalized by the size of the subset, is tight around $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \log N - \frac{1}{4 \sqrt{\pi}} \log \log N$, where $N$ is the scale parameter. This proves an analog, for the wired case, of a conjecture by Bramson and Zeitouni from 2009. The proof is based on comparison with the extremal landscape of the discrete Gaussian free field.

2024: On the Growth of the Extremal and Cluster Level Sets in Branching Brownian Motion
Abstract: We study the limiting extremal and cluster point processes of branching Brownian motion. The former records the heights of all extreme values of the process, while the latter records the relative heights of extreme values in a genealogical neighborhood of order unity around a local maximum thereof. For the extremal point process, we show that the mass of upper level sets $[-v, \infty)$ grows as $C_\star Z v e^{\sqrt{2} v}(1+o(1))$ as $v \to \infty$, almost surely, where $Z$ is the limit of the associated derivative martingale and $C_\star \in (0, \infty)$ is a universal constant. For the cluster point process, we show that the logarithm of the mass of $[-v, \infty)$ grow as $\sqrt{2}v$ minus random fluctuations of order $v^{2/3}$, which are governed by an explicit law in the limit. The first result improves upon the works of Cortines et al. (arXiv:1703.06529) and Mytnik et al. (arXiv:2009.02042) in which asymptotics are shown in probability, while the second makes rigorous the derivation in the physics literature by Mueller et al. (arXiv:1910.06382) and Le et al. (arXiv:2207.07672) and resolves a conjecture thereof.

2022: A toy model for DLA arm growth in a wedge
Abstract: . In this paper, we consider a non-homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain which can be seen as a toy model for the growth of the arms of the DLA (Diﬀusion limited aggregation) process in a sub-linear wedge. It is conjectured that in a thin enough linear wedge there is only one inﬁnite arm in the DLA cluster and we demonstrate this phenomenon in our model. The technique follows a bootstrapping argument, in which we iteratively prove ever faster growth rate.

2021: A limit law for the most favorite point of simplerandom walk on a regular tree
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time random walk on a regular tree of finite depth and study its favorite points among the leaf vertices. For the walk started from a leaf vertex and stopped upon hitting the root we prove that, in the limit as as the depth of the tree tends to infinity, the suitably scaled and centered maximal time spent at any leaf converges to a randomly-shifted Gumbel law. The random shift is characterized using a derivative-martingale like object associated with square-root local-time process on the tree.

2020: Near-maxima of the two-dimensional Discrete Gaussian Free Field
Abstract: For the Discrete Gaussian Free Field (DGFF) in domains $D_N\subseteq\mathbb Z^2$ arising, via scaling by $N$, from nice domains $D\subseteq\mathbb R^2$, we study the statistics of the values order-$\sqrt{\log N}$ below the absolute maximum. Encoded as a point process on $D\times\mathbb R$, the scaled spatial distribution of these near-extremal level sets in $D_N$ and the field values (in units of $\sqrt{\log N}$ below the absolute maximum) tends in law as $N\to\infty$ to the product of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity (cLQG) $Z^D$ and the Rayleigh law. The convergence holds jointly with the extremal process, for which $Z^D$ enters as the intensity measure of the limiting Poisson point process, and that of the DGFF itself; the cLQG defined by the limit field then coincides with $Z^D$. While the limit near-extremal process is measurable with respect to the limit continuum GFF, the limit extremal process is not. In a follow up paper, our results are used to study the fractal properties of the cLQG.

2019: Decorated Random Walk Restricted to Stay Below a Curve (Supplement Material)
Abstract: We consider a one dimensional random-walk-like process, whose steps are centered Gaussians with variances which are determined according to the sequence of arrivals of a Poisson process on the line. This process is decorated by independent random variables which are added at each step, but do not get accumulated. We study the probability that such process, conditioned to form a bridge, stays below a curve which grows at most polynomially fast away from the boundaries, with exponent less than one half. Both bounds and asymptotics are derived. These estimates are used in the manuscript "the structure of extreme level sets in branching Brownian motion" by the same authors, to which this manuscript is a supplement.

2019: More on the structure of extreme level sets in branching Brownian motion
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the manuscript "the structure of extreme level sets in branching Brownian motion", in which the same authors studied the fine structure of the extreme level sets of branching Brownian motion, namely the sets of particles whose height is within a finite distance from the global maximum. It is well known that such particles congregate at large times in clusters of order-one genealogical diameter around local maxima which form a Cox process in the limit. Our main finding here is that most of the particles in an extreme level set come from only a small fraction of the clusters, which are atypically large.

2017: Exploring an Infinite Space with Finite Memory Scouts
Abstract: Consider a small number of scouts exploring the infinite d-dimensional grid with the aim of hitting a hidden target point. Each scout is controlled by a probabilistic finite automaton that determines its movement (to a neighboring grid point) based on its current state. The scouts, that operate under a fully synchronous schedule, communicate with each other (in a way that affects their respective states) when they share the same grid point and operate independently otherwise. Our main research question is: How many scouts are required to guarantee that the target admits a finite mean hitting time? Recently, it was shown that d + 1 is an upper bound on the answer to this question for any dimension d ≥ 1 and the main contribution of this paper comes in the form of proving that this bound is tight for d ∈ {1, 2}.

2017: Dynamical Freezing in a Spin Glass System with Logarithmic Correlations
Abstract: We consider a continuous time random walk on the two-dimensional discrete torus, whose motion is governed by the discrete Gaussian free field on the corresponding box acting as a potential. More precisely, at any vertex the walk waits an exponentially distributed time with mean given by the exponential of the field and then jumps to one of its neighbors, chosen uniformly at random. We prove that throughout the low-temperature regime and at in-equilibrium timescales, the process admits a scaling limit as a spatial K-process driven by a random trapping landscape, which is explicitly related to the limiting extremal process of the field. Alternatively, the limiting process is a supercritical Liouville Brownian motion with respect to the continuum Gaussian free field on the box. This demonstrates rigorously and for the first time, as far as we know, a dynamical freezing in a spin glass system with logarithmically correlated energy levels.

2017: The structure of extreme level sets in branching Brownian motion
Abstract: We study the structure of extreme level sets of a standard one dimensional branching Brownian motion, namely the sets of particles whose height is within a fixed distance from the order of the global maximum. It is well known that such particles congregate at large times in clusters of order-one genealogical diameter around local maxima which form a Cox process in the limit. We add to these results by finding the asymptotic size of extreme level sets and the typical height and shape of those clusters which carry such level sets. We also find the right tail decay of the distribution of the distance between the two highest particles. These results confirm two conjectures of Brunet and Derrida, 2011. The proofs rely on studying the cluster distribution and should carry over to the branching random walk and the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field with no conceptual difficulty.

2016: On intermediate level sets of two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field
Abstract: We consider the discrete Gaussian Free Field (DGFF) in scaled-up (square-lattice) versions of suitably regular continuum domains $D\subset\mathbb C$ and describe the scaling limit, including local structure, of the level sets at heights growing as a $\lambda$-multiple of the height of the absolute maximum, for any $\lambda\in(0,1)$. We prove that, in the scaling limit, the scaled spatial position of a typical point $x$ sampled from this level set is distributed according to a Liouville Quantum Gravity (LQG) measure in $D$ at parameter equal $\lambda$-times its critical value, the field value at $x$ has an exponential intensity measure and the configuration near $x$ reduced by the value at $x$ has the law of a pinned DGFF reduced by a suitable multiple of the potential kernel. In particular, the law of the total size of the level set, properly-normalized, converges that that of the total mass of the LQG measure. This sharpens considerably an earlier conclusion by Daviaud.

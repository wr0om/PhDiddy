2022: FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A WEB-BASED COGNITIVE TRAINING PLATFORM FOR OLDER ADULTS: THE BREAKFAST TASK
Abstract: Abstract Background Developing efficient cognitive training for the older population is a major public health goal due to its potential cognitive benefits. A promising cognitive training target is executive control, critical for multitasking in everyday life. The aim of this pilot study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of the Breakfast Task in older adults, a new web-based cognitive training platform that simulates real-life multitasking demands. Research Design and Methods A community-based sample of 24 cognitively healthy participants aged between 60 and 75 (M = 69.12, SD = 3.83) underwent an online 5-session training protocol. Each session lasted 40 minutes and occurred twice a week at participant’s homes. Game performance was recorded, and participants completed questionnaires at baseline and after the intervention. Results Feasibility metrics showed overall high recruitment (82.7%), adherence and retention rates (100%). Acceptability was considered good based on participant`s quantitative and qualitative responses. On average, participants rated the game as interesting, enjoyable and did not report difficulties in accessing the game online or in understanding the instructions. Moreover, participants showed a learning curve across sessions, improvement in most game outcomes and benefits from the emphasis change approach. Discussion and Implications: The findings provide preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of the Breakfast Task training platform with community-dwelling older adults and demonstrate potential cognitive benefits. Results suggest the value of further research investigating the Breakfast Task features and dose-response relationship, as well as its efficacy in older adults via larger randomized controlled trials.

2019: The Effect of Confidence Rating on a Primary Visual Task
Abstract: The current study explored the influence of confidence rating on visual acuity. We used brief exposures of the Landolt gap discrimination task, probing the primary visual ability to detect contrast. During 200 practice trials, participants in the Confidence Rating group rated their response-confidence in each trial. A second (Time Delay) group received a short break at the end of each trial, equivalent to the average rating response time of the Confidence Rating group. The third (Standard Task) group performed the Landolt gap task in its original form. During practice, the Confidence Rating group developed an efficient monitoring ability indicated by a significant correlation between accuracy and confidence rating and a moderate calibration index score. Following practice, all groups performed 400 identical test trials of the standard Landolt gap task. In the test trials, the Confidence Rating group responded more accurately than the control groups, though it did not differ from them in response time for correct answers. Remarkably, the Confidence Rating group was significantly slower when making errors, compared the control groups. An interaction in learning efficiency occurred: the Confidence Rating group significantly improved its reaction times after the initial practice, as compared to both control groups. The findings demonstrate an effect of confidence rating on the formation of processing and response strategies, which granted participants significant benefits in later performance.

2018: The Joint Effects of Spatial Cueing and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Visual Acuity
Abstract: The present study examined the mutual influence of cortical neuroenhancement and allocation of spatial attention on perception. Specifically, it explored the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on visual acuity measured with a Landolt gap task and attentional precues. The exogenous cues were used to draw attention either to the location of the target or away from it, generating significant performance benefits and costs. Anodal tDCS applied to posterior occipital area for 15 min improved performance during stimulation, reflecting heightened visual acuity. Reaction times were lower, and accuracy was higher in the tDCS group, compared to a sham control group. Additionally, in post-stimulation trials tDCS significantly interacted with the effect of precuing. Reaction times were lower in valid cued trials (benefit) and higher in invalid trials (cost) compared to neutrally cued trials, the effect which was pronounced stronger in tDCS group than in sham control group. The increase of cost and benefit effects in the tDCS group was of a similar magnitude, suggesting that anodal tDCS influenced the overall process of attention orienting. The observed interaction between the stimulation of the visual cortex and precueing indicates a magnification of attention modulation.

2016: Age-Based Differences in Task Switching Are Moderated by Executive Control Demands
Abstract: Objectives
Recent work has identified different aspects of executive function that may underlie cognitive changes associated with age. The current study used a multifactorial design to investigate age sensitivity in the ability to shift between different task sets and the interaction of this ability with several specific aspects of executive control.


Method
A large, well-characterized sample of younger (n = 40) and clinically healthy older (n = 51) adults completed a task switching paradigm in which 3 aspects of executive control were manipulated between subjects: a) sensorimotor demand (the number of distinct stimulus-response options); b) stimulus-level interference (i.e., flanker effects); and c) updating/monitoring (the frequency of task switches).


Results
Unique age-related deficits were observed for different aspects of local task switching performance costs and updating/monitoring, but not for interference. Sensorimotor demand was also an important additional factor that interacted with task switching performance.


Discussion
Our findings suggest that task switching, coupled with infrequent and unexpected transitions from one task set to another, in the context of high motoric demands, is particularly difficult for older adults.

2016: Guiding Principles for a Pediatric Neurology ICU (neuroPICU) Bedside Multimodal Monitor
Abstract: Summary Background Physicians caring for children with serious acute neurologic disease must process overwhelming amounts of physiological and medical information. Strategies to optimize real time display of this information are understudied. Objectives Our goal was to engage clinical and engineering experts to develop guiding principles for creating a pediatric neurology intensive care unit (neuroPICU) monitor that integrates and displays data from multiple sources in an intuitive and informative manner. Methods To accomplish this goal, an international group of physicians and engineers communicated regularly for one year. We integrated findings from clinical observations, interviews, a survey, signal processing, and visualization exercises to develop a concept for a neuroPICU display. Results Key conclusions from our efforts include: (1) A neuroPICU display should support (a) rapid review of retrospective time series (i.e. cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic physiology data), (b) rapidly modifiable formats for viewing that data according to the specialty of the reviewer, and (c) communication of the degree of risk of clinical decline. (2) Specialized visualizations of physiologic parameters can highlight abnormalities in multivariable temporal data. Examples include 3-D stacked spider plots and color coded time series plots. (3) Visual summaries of EEG with spectral tools (i.e. hemispheric asymmetry and median power) can highlight seizures via patient-specific “fingerprints.” (4) Intuitive displays should emphasize subsets of physiology and processed EEG data to provide a rapid gestalt of the current status and medical stability of a patient. Conclusions A well-designed neuroPICU display must present multiple datasets in dynamic, flexible, and informative views to accommodate clinicians from multiple disciplines in a variety of clinical scenarios.

2015: Evaluation of multimodal feedback effects on the time-course of motor learning in multimodal VR platform for rowing training
Abstract: This study focused on the benefits of feedback augmentation for multi-session training of a complex motor-cognitive skill of indoor rowing in virtual environment. Specifically, we compared the effectiveness of augmented information feedback provided per training trial either visually, haptically or visual-haptically to the non-augmented condition, where no on-line feedback on task performance was afforded during training sessions. Surprisingly, the non-augmented training group was in general as successful in the long-term learning of a rowing skill as the augmented groups and according to some measures even superior to them. Our results also highlight important differences in the course of learning and skill representation upon different feedback conditions provided during training and may provide useful insights to the optimization for both sport and rehabilitation training protocols in VR.

2013: Task Analysis for Developing Maintenance and Assembly VR Training Simulators
Abstract: Task analysis for the development of a virtual reality (VR) training system requires analysis and identification of the operator’s interactions with the real-world system and of the objectives of training and the trainee’s skill acquisition requirements. A task analysis approach for developing VR training simulators is presented that is based on analyzing the technology and training requirements concurrently. This approach is compared with traditional approaches for system development, with examples provided from the development of a VR training simulator for industrial maintenance and assembly tasks.

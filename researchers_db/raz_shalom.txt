2017: Modelling and Simulation of DFIG-WT for Voltage Regulation
Abstract: Nowadays, wind energy is considered as one of the most developing and promising renewable energy sources. Because of power electronics advancements, wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) equipped with Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) for variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs) are one of the most efficient topologies for WECS. Further, due to the merits of DFIG over other generators, it is involved in most of wind power applications. Therefore, modelling and simulation of DFIG coupled with VSWT has taken a great attention by researches. In this article, power generation control in variable-speed variable-pitch horizontal-axis wind turbines operating at high wind speeds is studied. Response of DFIG wind turbine system to grid disturbances is simulated. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers for power regulation and demonstrate high-performance. A dynamic chattering torque control and a proportional integral PI pitch control strategies are proposed and validated using MATLAB software program.

2010: Multichannel Deconvolution of Seismic Signals Using Statistical MCMC Methods
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two multichannel blind deconvolution algorithms for the restoration of two-dimensional (2D) seismic data. Both algorithms are based on a 2D reflectivity prior model, and use iterative multichannel deconvolution procedures which deconvolve the seismic data, while taking into account the spatial dependency between neighboring traces. The first algorithm employs in each step a modified maximum posterior mode (MPM) algorithm which estimates a reflectivity column from the corresponding observed trace using the estimate of the preceding reflectivity column. The second algorithm takes into account estimates of both the preceding and subsequent columns in the estimation process. Both algorithms are applied to synthetic and real data and demonstrate better results compared to those obtained by a single-channel deconvolution method. Expectedly, the second algorithm which utilizes more information in the estimation process of each reflectivity column is shown to produce better results than the first algorithm.

1999: Gabor transform of time-varying systems: exact representation and approximation
Abstract: Approximate modeling of discrete-time linear time-varying systems is studied based on a representation of linear systems in the Gabor time-frequency space. The time-varying system is assumed to be given in input-output or kernel representation. This representation has previously received attention because of its applicability in frozen-time analysis and design of optimal control for time-varying systems but requires a large number of coefficients. Motivated by its application to signal analysis, the Gabor transform is considered as a tool for the representation and approximation of linear time-variant systems. In order to show the main results, the class of systems considered is restricted to the one usually considered in the frozen-time approach. An example is included to illustrate the potential application of the technique.

1998: Time-frequency analysis and noise suppression with shift-invariant wavelet packets
Abstract: Cross terms associated with bilinear distributions are not necessarily interpretable as interference terms. Any signal can be broken up in an infinite number of ways, each of which generates different cross terms. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate decomposition that separates the parts which are well delineated in the time-frequency plane. We have presented a modified Wigner distribution, where undesirable interference-terms can be eliminated while still retaining high energy concentration. A prescribed signal is expanded into a redundant library of orthonormal wavelet packet bases, from which the best decomposition is selected, and subsequently transformed into the Wigner domain. The discrimination between beneficial cross terms, which primarily enhance the useful properties of the time-frequency representation, and undesirable interference terms is determined according to the degree of adjacency and relative amplitudes of the interacting basis functions; only adjacent pairs whose coefficients are large enough are related to the same component of the signal. The balance between interference terms, concentration and computational complexity is achieved by adjusting the distance and amplitude thresholds.

1998: Adaptive time-frequency distributions via the shift-invariant wavelet packet decomposition
Abstract: Utilizing the shift-invariant wavelet packet decomposition (SIWPD), various useful properties relevant to time-frequency analysis, including high energy concentration and suppressed interference terms, can be achieved simultaneously in the Wigner domain. A prescribed signal is expanded on its best basis and transformed into the Wigner domain. Subsequently, the interference terms are eliminated by adaptively thresholding the cross Wigner distribution of interactive basis functions, according to their amplitudes and distance in an idealized time-frequency plane. The properties of the resultant modified Wigner distribution (MWD) are investigated, and its performance in eliminating interference terms, while still retaining high energy resolution, is compared with that of other existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MWD to resolving multicomponent signals. Each component is determined as a partial sum of basis-functions over a certain equivalence class in the time-frequency plane.

1998: MDL-based translation-invariant denoising and robust time-frequency representations
Abstract: A translation-invariant denoising method, based on the minimum description length (MDL) criterion and the shift-invariant wavelet packet decomposition (SIWPD) is presented. A collection of signal models is generated using an extended library of orthonormal wavelet-packet bases, and an additive cost function, approximately representing the MDL principle, is derived. We show that the minimum description length of the noisy observed data is achieved by utilizing the SIWPD and thresholding the resulting coefficients. The signal estimator is combined with a modified Wigner distribution, yielding robust time-frequency representations, characterized by the high resolution and suppressed interference-terms. The proposed method is compared with alternative approaches, and its superiority is demonstrated.

1997: Eliminating interference terms in the Wigner distribution using extended libraries of bases
Abstract: The Wigner distribution (WD) possesses a number of desirable mathematical properties relevant to time-frequency analysis. However, the presence of interference terms renders the WD of multicomponent signals extremely difficult to interpret. We propose an adaptive decomposition of the WD using extended libraries of orthonormal bases. A prescribed signal is expanded on a basis of adapted waveforms, that best match the signal components, and subsequently transformed into the Wigner domain. The interference terms are controlled by thresholding the cross WD of interactive basis functions according to their degree of adjacency in an idealized time-frequency plane. This measure is implicitly adapted to the local distribution of the signal, thus compensating for a global nonadaptive threshold. In particular we focus on a shift-invariant decomposition in an extended library of wavelet packets. The resulting modified distribution achieves high time-frequency resolution, and is superior in eliminating interference terms associated with bilinear distributions.

1996: Best Basis Algorithm for OrthonormalShift-Invariant Trigonometric
Abstract: The Local Cosine Decomposition of Coifman and Wickerhauser 1] is modiied by incorporating two degrees of freedom that increase the adaptability of the best basis. These are relative shifts between resolution levels and adaptive polarity foldings. The resultant expansion is shift-invariant, and yields adaptive time-frequency distributions which are characterized by high resolution, high concentration and suppressed cross-terms associated with the Wigner distribution .

1996: Best basis algorithm for orthonormal shift-invariant trigonometric decomposition
Abstract: Adaptive signal representations in overcomplete libraries of waveforms have been widely used. The local cosine decomposition of Coifman and Wickerhauser (see IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., vol.38, no.3, p.713-18, 1992) is modified by incorporating two degrees of freedom that increase the adaptability of the best basis. These are relative shifts between resolution levels and adaptive polarity foldings. The resultant expansion is shift-invariant, and yields adaptive time-frequency distributions which are characterized by high resolution, high concentration and suppressed cross-terms associated with the Wigner distribution.

1995: Shift invariant wavelet packet bases
Abstract: A shifted wavelet packet (SWP) library, containing all the time shifted wavelet packet bases, is defined. A corresponding shift-invariant wavelet packet decomposition (SIWPD) search algorithm for a "best basis" is introduced. The search algorithm is representable by a binary tree, in which a node symbolizes an appropriate subspace of the original signal. We prove that the resultant "best basis" is orthonormal and the associated expansion, characterized by the lowest "information cost", is shift-invariant. The shift-invariance stems from an additional degree of freedom, generated at the decomposition stage, and incorporated into the search algorithm. We prove that for any subspace it suffices to consider one of two alternative decompositions, made feasible by the SWP library. The computational complexity of SIWPD may be controlled at the expense of the attained information cost, to an extent of O(2Nlog/sub 2/N).

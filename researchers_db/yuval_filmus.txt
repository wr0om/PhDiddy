2024: Bandit-Feedback Online Multiclass Classification: Variants and Tradeoffs
Abstract: Consider the domain of multiclass classification within the adversarial online setting. What is the price of relying on bandit feedback as opposed to full information? To what extent can an adaptive adversary amplify the loss compared to an oblivious one? To what extent can a randomized learner reduce the loss compared to a deterministic one? We study these questions in the mistake bound model and provide nearly tight answers. We demonstrate that the optimal mistake bound under bandit feedback is at most $O(k)$ times higher than the optimal mistake bound in the full information case, where $k$ represents the number of labels. This bound is tight and provides an answer to an open question previously posed and studied by Daniely and Helbertal ['13] and by Long ['17, '20], who focused on deterministic learners. Moreover, we present nearly optimal bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(k)$ on the gap between randomized and deterministic learners, as well as between adaptive and oblivious adversaries in the bandit feedback setting. This stands in contrast to the full information scenario, where adaptive and oblivious adversaries are equivalent, and the gap in mistake bounds between randomized and deterministic learners is a constant multiplicative factor of $2$. In addition, our results imply that in some cases the optimal randomized mistake bound is approximately the square-root of its deterministic parallel. Previous results show that this is essentially the smallest it can get.

2024: Separating Coverage and Submodular: Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint
Abstract: We consider two classic problems: maximum coverage and monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint. [Nemhauser--Wolsey--Fisher '78] proved that the greedy algorithm provides an approximation of $1-1/e$ for both problems, and it is known that this guarantee is tight ([Nemhauser--Wolsey '78; Feige '98]). Thus, one would naturally assume that everything is resolved when considering the approximation guarantees of these two problems, as both exhibit the same tight approximation and hardness. In this work we show that this is not the case, and study both problems when the cardinality constraint is a constant fraction $c \in (0,1]$ of the ground set. We prove that monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint admits an approximation of $1-(1-c)^{1/c}$; This approximation equals $1$ when $c=1$ and it gracefully degrades to $1-1/e$ when $c$ approaches $0$. Moreover, for every $c=1/s$ (for any integer $s \in \mathbb{N}$) we present a matching hardness. Surprisingly, for $c=1/2$ we prove that Maximum Coverage admits an approximation of $0.7533$, thus separating the two problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known example of a well-studied maximization problem for which coverage and monotone submodular objectives exhibit a different best possible approximation.

2023: Bounded Simultaneous Messages
Abstract: We consider the following question of bounded simultaneous messages (BSM) protocols: Can computationally unbounded Alice and Bob evaluate a function $f(x,y)$ of their inputs by sending polynomial-size messages to a computationally bounded Carol? The special case where $f$ is the mod-2 inner-product function and Carol is bounded to AC$^0$ has been studied in previous works. The general question can be broadly motivated by applications in which distributed computation is more costly than local computation, including secure two-party computation. In this work, we initiate a more systematic study of the BSM model, with different functions $f$ and computational bounds on Carol. In particular, we give evidence against the existence of BSM protocols with polynomial-size Carol for naturally distributed variants of NP-complete languages.

2023: Low degree functions which are almost Boolean
Abstract: The original statement of Kindler and Safra approximates f by a Boolean junta g which doesn’t necessarily have degree d. We deduce this version by observing that if g doesn’t have degree d then it must be somewhat far from f since the latter does have degree d. In contrast to the case d = 1, in general we do not have a list of all Boolean degree d function (though such a list does exist for d = 2). Nevertheless, we can say that all such functions are juntas, and moreover can be represented as decision trees of depth poly(d).

2023: Proving Unsatisfiability with Hitting Formulas
Abstract: Hitting formulas have been studied in many different contexts at least since [Iwama,89]. A hitting formula is a set of Boolean clauses such that any two of them cannot be simultaneously falsified. [Peitl,Szeider,05] conjectured that hitting formulas should contain the hardest formulas for resolution. They supported their conjecture with experimental findings. Using the fact that hitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we use them to build a static proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an unsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a clause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof systems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas. We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially separated. We prove that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like resolution, thus hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution, so Peitl-Szeider's conjecture is partially refuted. Nevertheless Hitting is surprisingly difficult to polynomially simulate. Using the ideas of PIT for noncommutative circuits [Raz-Shpilka,05] we show that Hitting is simulated by Extended Frege. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic systems are verifiable in a deterministic polynomial time. We consider multiple extensions of Hitting. Hitting(+) formulas are conjunctions of clauses containing affine equations instead of just literals, and every assignment falsifies at most one clause. The resulting system is related to Res(+) proof system for which no superpolynomial lower bounds are known: Hitting(+) simulates the tree-like version of Res(+) and is at least quasi-polynomially stronger. We show an exponential lower bound for Hitting(+).

2023: MC-finiteness of restricted set partition functions
Abstract: A sequence $s(n)$ of integers is MC-finite if for every $m \in \mathbb{N}^+$ the sequence $s^m(n) = s(n) \bmod{m}$ is ultimately periodic. We discuss various ways of proving and disproving MC-finiteness. Our examples are mostly taken from set partition functions, but our methods can be applied to many more integer sequences.

2023: Optimal Prediction Using Expert Advice and Randomized Littlestone Dimension
Abstract: A classical result in online learning characterizes the optimal mistake bound achievable by deterministic learners using the Littlestone dimension (Littlestone '88). We prove an analogous result for randomized learners: we show that the optimal expected mistake bound in learning a class $\mathcal{H}$ equals its randomized Littlestone dimension, which is the largest $d$ for which there exists a tree shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ whose average depth is $2d$. We further study optimal mistake bounds in the agnostic case, as a function of the number of mistakes made by the best function in $\mathcal{H}$, denoted by $k$. We show that the optimal randomized mistake bound for learning a class with Littlestone dimension $d$ is $k + \Theta (\sqrt{k d} + d )$. This also implies an optimal deterministic mistake bound of $2k + \Theta(d) + O(\sqrt{k d})$, thus resolving an open question which was studied by Auer and Long ['99]. As an application of our theory, we revisit the classical problem of prediction using expert advice: about 30 years ago Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and Warmuth studied prediction using expert advice, provided that the best among the $n$ experts makes at most $k$ mistakes, and asked what are the optimal mistake bounds. Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Helmbold, and Warmuth ['93, '96] provided a nearly optimal bound for deterministic learners, and left the randomized case as an open problem. We resolve this question by providing an optimal learning rule in the randomized case, and showing that its expected mistake bound equals half of the deterministic bound of Cesa-Bianchi et al. ['93,'96], up to negligible additive terms. In contrast with previous works by Abernethy, Langford, and Warmuth ['06], and by Br\^anzei and Peres ['19], our result applies to all pairs $n,k$.

2023: Generalized Polymorphisms
Abstract: We find all functions $f_0,f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and $g_0,g_1,\dots,g_n\colon \{0,1\}^m \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following identity for all $n \times m$ matrices $(z_{ij}) \in \{0,1\}^{n \times m}$: \[ f_0(g_1(z_{11},\dots,z_{1m}),\dots,g_n(z_{n1},\dots,z_{nm})) = g_0(f_1(z_{11},\dots,z_{n1}),\dots,f_m(z_{1m},\dots,z_{nm})). \] Our results generalize work of Dokow and Holzman (2010), which considered the case $g_0 = g_1 = \cdots = g_n$, and of Chase, Filmus, Minzer, Mossel and Saurabh (2022), which considered the case $g_0 \neq g_1 = \cdots = g_n$.

2023: Sparse Graph Counting and Kelley-Meka Bounds for Binary Systems
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kelley and Meka (FOCS 2023) obtained a strong upper bound on the density of sets of integers without non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions. In this work, we extend their result, establishing similar bounds for all linear patterns defined by binary systems of linear forms, where “binary” indicates that every linear form depends on exactly two variables. Prior to our work, no strong bounds were known for such systems even in the finite field model setting. A key ingredient in our proof is a graph counting lemma. The classical graph counting lemma, developed by Thomason (Random Graphs 1985) and Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 1989), is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. For a fixed graph $H$, it states that the number of copies of $H$ in a pseudorandom graph $G$ is similar to the number of copies of $H$ in a purely random graph with the same edge density as $G$. However, this lemma is only non-trivial when $G$ is a dense graph. In this work, we prove a graph counting lemma that is also effective when $G$ is sparse. Moreover, our lemma is well-suited for density increment arguments in additive number theory. As an immediate application, we obtain a strong bound for the Turán problem in abelian Cayley sum graphs: let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group with odd order. If a Cayley sum graph on $\Gamma$ does not contain any r-elique as a sub graph, it must have at most $2^{-\Omega_r\left(\log ^{1 / 16}\vert \Gamma\vert \right)} \cdot\vert \Gamma\vert ^2$ edges. These results hinge on the technology developed by Kelley and Meka and the follow-up work by Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC 2024).

2023: Sampling and Certifying Symmetric Functions
Abstract: A circuit $\mathcal{C}$ samples a distribution $\mathbf{X}$ with an error $\epsilon$ if the statistical distance between the output of $\mathcal{C}$ on the uniform input and $\mathbf{X}$ is $\epsilon$. We study the hardness of sampling a uniform distribution over the set of $n$-bit strings of Hamming weight $k$ denoted by $\mathbf{U}^n_k$ for _decision forests_, i.e. every output bit is computed as a decision tree of the inputs. For every $k$ there is an $O(\log n)$-depth decision forest sampling $\mathbf{U}^n_k$ with an inverse-polynomial error [Viola 2012, Czumaj 2015]. We show that for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $\tau$ such that for decision depth $\tau \log (n/k) / \log \log (n/k)$, the error for sampling $\mathbf{U}_k^n$ is at least $1-\epsilon$. Our result is based on the recent robust sunflower lemma [Alweiss, Lovett, Wu, Zhang 2021, Rao 2019]. Our second result is about matching a set of $n$-bit strings with the image of a $d$-_local_ circuit, i.e. such that each output bit depends on at most $d$ input bits. We study the set of all $n$-bit strings whose Hamming weight is at least $n/2$. We improve the previously known locality lower bound from $\Omega(\log^* n)$ [Beyersdorff, Datta, Krebs, Mahajan, Scharfenberger-Fabian, Sreenivasaiah, Thomas and Vollmer, 2013] to $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$, leaving only a quartic gap from the best upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$.

2022: A simple proof of the Kindler–Safra theorem
Abstract: A Boolean degree 1 function (on a Boolean cube {0, 1}) is a dictator. Friedgut, Kalai and Naor [FKN02] showed that if a Boolean function is close to degree 1, then it is close to a Boolean dictator. Nisan and Szegedy [NS94] showed that a Boolean degree d function is an O(d2)-junta. The size of the junta was later improved to O(2), which is optimal up to the hidden constant [CHS20, Wel20]. Kindler and Safra [KS02, Kin03] shows that if a Boolean degree d function is close to degree d, then it is close to a Boolean degree d function. In this note, we give a simple proof of the Kindler–Safra theorem using the invariance principle. Our proof works in the more general setting of A-valued functions, which are functions whose output lies in some finite set A; this generalizes the Boolean setting, which corresponds to A = {0, 1}.

2022: Simple Algebraic Proofs of Uniqueness for Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorems
Abstract: We give simpler algebraic proofs of uniqueness for several Erdős-Ko-Rado results, i.e., that the canonically intersecting families are the only largest intersecting families. Using these techniques, we characterize the largest partially 2-intersecting families of perfect hypermatchings, resolving a recent conjecture of Meagher, Shirazi, and Stevens.

2022: A Resilient Distributed Boosting Algorithm
Abstract: Given a learning task where the data is distributed among several parties, communication is one of the fundamental resources which the parties would like to minimize. We present a distributed boosting algorithm which is resilient to a limited amount of noise. Our algorithm is similar to classical boosting algorithms, although it is equipped with a new component, inspired by Impagliazzo’s hard-core lemma (Impagliazzo, 1995), adding a robustness quality to the algorithm. We also complement this result by showing that resilience to any asymptotically larger noise is not achievable by a communication-efﬁcient algorithm.

2022: Irreducible subcube partitions
Abstract: A subcube partition is a partition of the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ into subcubes. A subcube partition is irreducible if the only sub-partitions whose union is a subcube are singletons and the entire partition. A subcube partition is tight if it “mentions” all coordinates. 
We study extremal properties of tight irreducible subcube partitions: minimal size, minimal weight, maximal number of points, maximal size, and maximal minimum dimension. We also consider the existence of homogeneous tight irreducible subcube partitions, in which all subcubes have the same dimensions. We additionally study subcube partitions of $\{0,\dots,q-1\}^n$, and partitions of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ into affine subspaces, in both cases focusing on the minimal size. 
Our constructions and computer experiments lead to several conjectures on the extremal values of the aforementioned properties.

2022: Junta threshold for low degree Boolean functions on the slice
Abstract: We show that a Boolean degree~$d$ function on the slice $\binom{[n]}{k}$ is a junta if $k \geq 2d$, and that this bound is sharp. We prove a similar result for $A$-valued degree~$d$ functions for arbitrary finite $A$, and for functions on an infinite analog of the slice.

2025: An Improved and Explainable Electricity Price Forecasting Model via SHAP-Based Error Compensation Approach
Abstract: Forecasting errors in power markets, even as small as 1%, can have significant financial implications. However, even high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) based electricity price forecasting (EPF) models have instances when their prediction error is much higher than those shown by mean performance metrics. To date, explainable AI has been used to enhance the model transparency and trustworthiness of AI-based EPF models. However, this article demonstrates that insights from explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be expanded beyond its primary task of explanatory visualizations. This work presents a XAI-based error compensation approach to improve model performance and identify irregular predictions. The first phase of the proposed approach involves error quantification through a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) based corrector model that fine-tunes the base predictor's forecasts. Using this corrector model's SHAP explanations, the proposed approach distinguishes high-accuracy predictions from lower ones in the second stage. Additionally, these explanations are more simplified than the base model, making them easier for nonexpert users such as bidding agents. Performance enhancement and insightful user-centric explanations are crucial for real-world scenarios such as price spikes during network congestion, high renewable penetration, and fluctuating fuel costs. Case studies discussed here show the efficacy of the proposed approach independent of model architecture, feature combination, or behavioral patterns of electricity prices in different markets.

2024: Reinforcement Learning Model-Based and Model-Free Paradigms for Optimal Control Problems in Power Systems: Comprehensive Review and Future Directions
Abstract: This paper reviews recent works related to applications of reinforcement learning in power system optimal control problems. Based on an extensive analysis of works in the recent literature, we attempt to better understand the gap between reinforcement learning methods that rely on complete or incomplete information about the model dynamics and data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. More specifically we ask how such models change based on the application or the algorithm, what the currently open theoretical and numerical challenges are in each of the leading applications, and which reinforcement-based control strategies will rise in the following years. The reviewed research works are divided into “model-based” methods and “model-free” methods in order to highlight the current developments and trends within each of these two groups. The optimal control problems reviewed are energy markets, grid stability and control, energy management in buildings, electrical vehicles, and energy storage.

2024: Implementation of Series Resonance-Based Fault Current Limiter for Enhanced Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Farm
Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an improved resonance-type FCL, designed to enhance the transient stability of a photovoltaic farm. This FCL overcomes the well-known drawbacks associated with the conventional resonance-based FCLs. This FCL limits the fault during the fault period, quickly achieves stability during the recovery period, independent of the reactor’s charging state, and notably reduces DC-link voltage fluctuations during faults. A power system simulation setup comprising a PV farm, synchronous generator, transformers, circuit breakers, transmission system, and several branches of loads is used for testing the proposed FCL. The simulation results validate that the proposed FCL better improves the system’s stability and leads to improved fault current, PCC voltage, active power, reactive power, and DC-link voltage compared to other common types of resonant FCLs.

2024: Uses of the Popov Stability Criterion for Analyzing Global Asymptotic Stability in Power System Dynamic Models
Abstract: Stability studies remain a crucial aspect of power systems dynamic analysis, and are typically explored in three main categories: numerical methods, linearization techniques, or direct methods, which utilize Lyapunov energy functions. This paper belongs to the third category, and highlights the usefulness of the Popov stability criterion in the analysis of nonlinear power system models. The main advantage of this criterion is that it provides conditions for global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, for a nonlinear dynamic system. We show a general method to apply this stability criterion, and examine its uses in several specific applications and case-studies. The results are demonstrated by analyzing the stability of a system that includes a grid-connected storage device and a renewable energy source.

2024: Testing the Local Stability of a Multi-Machine Power System with Constant Power Loads
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of switched power converters within the power grid as both sources and sinks, the necessity arises for establishing verifiable stability conditions. We assume here that power sources can be modelled as synchronous generators - this encompasses virtual synchronous generators - while power sinks are operating as constant power loads. We provide a small-signal stability criterion for a model that uses time-varying phasors, characterized by a lossless transmission network and constant power loads distributed throughout the network. A key concept in this study is the matrix $H$, representing the partial derivatives of the generator powers with respect to their relative angles, computed at an equilibrium point. Our main result is that $H > 0$ implies the local asymptotic stability of this equilibrium point. Moreover, the equilibrium point is unstable if $H$ is full-rank and not positive definite. To demonstrate the practical significance of our theorem, we conduct a case study, highlighting its applicability in real-world scenarios.

2024: Hierarchical Optimization Configuration Strategy of Synchronous Condenser in High Penetration Wind Power Sending Systems
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large-scale wind turbines in place of conventional generators is expected to lead to the dominance of asynchronous power sources in future power systems, further accelerating the trend toward grid electrification. As a result, the ability of power sources to support system voltage and frequency is gradually diminishing. Synchronous condensers (SCs), which are synchronous machines operating without prime movers, serve as effective devices for providing both dynamic voltage support and inertia. They can significantly enhance the system’s capacity to maintain voltage and frequency stability. However, most existing studies on the optimization of synchronous condenser configurations tend to focus on only one aspect at a time rather than addressing both simultaneously, limiting the full potential of these devices. Optimizing either the voltage or frequency in isolation often results in suboptimal improvements in the other. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of both voltage and frequency can lead to non-convergent outcomes, complicating the search for an optimal solution. To address this, the paper proposes a hierarchical optimization strategy for synchronous condenser configuration aimed at enhancing both voltage and frequency stability. First, the connection sites for the synchronous condensers are determined based on short-circuit ratio (SCR) constraints. Next, an outer layer optimization model is developed to minimize the total installed capacity of the condensers while taking into account the SCR and transient overvoltage levels as constraints. Following this, an inner layer optimization model is introduced, incorporating a rate of change in the frequency fRoCoF and maximum frequency deviation fnadir as constraints. The model is solved using the bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA). Finally, a case study of a power grid with a high proportion of wind power validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous condenser configuration strategy. Compared to traditional methods, the total required capacity of synchronous condensers was significantly reduced.

2024: On the Stability of Strategic Energy Storage Operation in Wholesale Electricity Markets (Extended Version)
Abstract: High shares of variable renewable energy necessitate substantial energy storage capacity. However, it remains unclear how to design a market that, on the one hand, ensures a stable and sufficient income for storage firms, and, on the other hand, maintains stable and affordable electricity costs for the consumers. Here, we use a game theoretic model to study storage competition in wholesale electricity markets. A main result is that these types of games are not necessarily stable. In particular, we find that under certain conditions, which imply a combination of a high share of variable renewable energy sources and low flexibility of conventional power plants, the system will not converge to an equilibrium. However, we demonstrate that a price cap on storage price bids can ensure convergence to a stable solution. Moreover, we find that when the flexibility of conventional power plants is low, while the storage usage for energy balancing increases with renewable energy generation, the profitability of using storage for the sole purpose of energy arbitrage decreases.

2024: Using Multiple Stator Windings and Multi-Level Converters for Frequency Matching in Microturbine Generators
Abstract: The microturbine generator is a useful power source in distributed generation applications, but usually requires a conversion stage, to match its frequency to that of the utility grid. In this work we propose using multiple stator windings for frequency matching in microturbine generators. This approach is based on the idea that the generator itself can be seen as a transformer, with multiple windings. Following this logic, we propose to redesign the microturbine stator windings as multiple transformers, replacing a single 3-phase output with multiple 3-phase outputs. Each output is rectified, and function as an individual isolated DC voltage source, which connects directly to a modular multilevel converter. The proposed method uses no additional magnetic components other than the ones that already exist on the modified stator. Therefore, it can significantly minimize the overall system's footprint. Additionally, this method uses a low switching frequency, as low as the utility grid's frequency, which allows using very simple switching devices, with low switching losses. Another unique feature of this method is that as the number of submodule stages is increased, the output filter is considerably simplified. The results are verified using simulations and experiments.

2024: Leveraging Bitcoin Mining Machines in Demand-Response Mechanisms to Mitigate Ramping-Induced Transients
Abstract: We propose an extended demand response program, based on ancillary service for supplying flexible electricity demand. In our proposed scheme, we suggest a broader management model to control the scheduling and power consumption of Bitcoin mining machines. The main aspect that we focus on is suppressing the power ramping and related transient effects. We extend previous works on the subject, that study the impact of incorporating cryptocurrency mining machines into existing power grid, and explore the potential profit of exploiting this flexible load in the Israeli electricity market. We analyze a trend based on historical data, of increasing electricity prices and ramping costs due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. We suggest an extension to the unit commitment problem from which we obtain the scheduling scheme of the Bitcoin mining machines. We use simulation and the real-world data acquired from the"Noga"grid operator to verify the proposed ancillary service and test its practical limits for reducing the ramping costs, under changing ratio of energy production from renewable sources. Out results suggests that the machine price and ratio of production from renewable sources plays a significant role in determining the profitability of the proposed demand-response program.

2024: Extended Observer Form for Nonlinear System with Disturbances: Algorithm and Application
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of transforming single-output nonlinear state equations affine in disturbance into an extended observer form whose nonlinear injection part depends additionally on the derivatives of the output up to a finite order. Moreover, the considered form is affine in disturbance. Based on the earlier results a detailed algorithm is given and applied to the model of a synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus. For the system in the extended observer form a reduced-order Kalman-filter based observer can be designed such that its error dynamics is exponentially attractive and it is stable in the input-to-state sense with respect to the disturbance.

2024: Evaluating Model Performance Through a User-Centric Explainable Framework for Probabilistic Load Forecasting Models
Abstract: Load forecasting models ensure efficient, secure, and stable operation of the modern power system. Probabilistic forecasting accounts for uncertainties associated with missing features that are often overlooked by deterministic approaches. However, machine learning-based probabilistic models are complicated. This paper proposes a user-centric explainable AI framework that presents global and local interpretations aligned with the expertise and explanation needs of the targeted user. The overall influence of temporal and spatial exogenous features at the model development stage is evaluated using the Permutation Feature Importance technique. Such an explanation provides a holistic picture of the knowledge gained by the Gradient Boosting Regressor-based probabilistic load forecasting model. Further-more, the proposed framework suggests the implementation of SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the post-deployment stage for individual forecast instances. Local explanations provided by SHAP are used to distinguish between interval forecasts with higher and lower forecast accuracy. Such distinction is applied for both the lower and upper bounds of the forecast interval. This is specifically useful for the non-AI expert end-users that need load forecasts for their strategizing their daily operations. This work is validated on the Kaggle data set on the national load demand of Panama supported with several other exogenous features such as weather-related quantities, holidays, and date-time details. Results show the efficacy of the proposed framework and its ability to provide user-friendly interpretations aligned with users' explanation goals.

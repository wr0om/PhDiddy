2024: Toward Monolithic GaN on Si Inter-Sub-Band Infrared Optoelectronics
Abstract: We have successfully demonstrated the first CMOS-compatible monolithic epitaxial integration of GaN-based infrared (IR) detectors on Si. The device is a GaN/AlGaN quantum cascade detector (QCD) grown selectively in windows on a 4-in Si (111) substrate using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The CMOS compatibility of the QCD growth method was verified by applying it to Si circuitry fabricated on (100) surface of a double hetero-oriented silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate. The photo signal, centered at a wavelength of 4.6 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, was measured at 110 K. The zero-bias responsivity of 81 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu \text{A}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>/W at 18 K and detectivity of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$1.2\times 10^{{7}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Jones were recorded.

2019: Design and implementation of bound-to-quasibound GaN/AlGaN photovoltaic quantum well infrared photodetectors operating in the short wavelength infrared range at room temperature
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the design of photovoltaic quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) based on polar GaN/AlGaN multiquantum wells (MQWs). Getting a reasonable escape probability of the excited electron requires adjusting the bound-to-quasibound intersubband transition in the absorbing quantum well and engineering the polarization-related internal electric field in the barriers. This can be achieved with a MQW period that consists of 3 layers, namely, the active quantum well, an extraction barrier, and an injection barrier, the latter being thin enough to allow tunneling transport. Following this design scheme, we demonstrate bound-to-quasibound GaN/AlGaN QWIPs with peak photocurrent response at 2.3 μm, operating at room temperature in both photovoltaic and photoconductive modes. Based on high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurements, the entire detector structure, which included a 40-period MQW with 30 nm-thick barriers, along with top and bottom contact layers of combined thickness above 900 nm, was grown pseudomorphically on an AlGaN-on-sapphire template. A room-temperature responsivity of 88 μA/W was measured at zero bias, increasing up to 302 μA/W at −1.0 V bias. The responsivity reached its maximum at 150–200 K, where it was approximately a factor of 2 higher than at room temperature. Ideas for a new device structure to improve the QWIP response in the photovoltaic mode are proposed.In this paper, we discuss the design of photovoltaic quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) based on polar GaN/AlGaN multiquantum wells (MQWs).

2017: Spectroscopy of electronic states in InAs quantum dots grown on In(x)Al(1-x)As/InP(001)
Abstract: We have investigated optical properties of high-density InAs self-assembled quantum dots ~ QDs ! in an In x Al 1 2 x As matrix, lattice matched to an InP ~ 001 ! substrate. The weak lattice mismatch ( ; 3%) results in a 90% coverage of the In x Al 1 2 x As surface with InAs QDs. By means of interband and intraband spectroscopies crossed with atomic force microscopy ~ AFM ! measurements, we have determined that the InAs QDs optical properties depend on the deposited amount of InAs. Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy has been used to investigate midinfrared intraband absorptions. For three monolayers ~ ML ! InAs deposit thickness, just above two-dimensional ~ 2D ! /3D growth mode transition ~ 2.5 ML ! , the islands form as isolated elliptical dots elongated along the @ 11 ¯ 0 # direction and exhibit intraband resonances polarized either along the @ 110 # or the @ 11 ¯ 0 # direction. For thicker deposition ( . 3 ML), InAs islands form chains of elliptical dots along the @ 11 ¯ 0 # direction where the quantum conﬁnement is lost, resulting in a quantum-wire-like behavior. In this paper, we also report on photoluminescence and photocurrent spectroscopies, in order to get insight into the InAs/In x Al 1 2 x As island band structure. These experimental results are in good agreement with that of a multiband k • p model.

2016: Controlling the dark exciton spin eigenstates by external magnetic field
Abstract: We study the dark exciton's behavior as a coherent physical two-level spin system (qubit) using an external magnetic field in the Faraday configuration. Our studies are based on polarization-sensitive intensity autocorrelation measurements of the optical transition resulting from the recombination of a spin-blockaded biexciton state, which heralds the dark exciton and its spin state. We demonstrate control over the dark exciton eigenstates without degrading its decoherence time. Our observations agree well with computational predictions based on a master equation model.

2015: Interatomic Coulombic decay in two coupled quantum wells
Abstract: Interatomic coulombic decay (ICD) is a relaxation process induced by electronic correlation. In this work we study the ICD process in a two coupled Quantum wells (QWs) nano-structure. We study a simple one-dimensional effective potential using experimental parameters of the semiconductor QW layers i.e. using the single band effective-mass approximation . In our calculations we consider the discontinuity of the effective mass of the electron in each of the QW layers. We control the ICD lifetime by changing the distance between the two wells. The expected overall trend is a decrease of ICD lifetime with a decrease in the distance between the wells. We show that the distance can be tuned such that the emitted ICD electron is trapped in a meta-stable state in the continuum i.e. a one electron resonance state. This causes the life time of the ICD to be an order of magnitude smaller even in very long distances, and improves the efficiency of the ICD. For the ICD to be dominant decay mechanism it must prevail over all other possible competitive decay processes. We have found that the lifetime of the ICD is on the timescale of picoseconds. Therefore, based on our results we can design an experiment that will observe the ICD phenomenon in QWs nano-structure for the first time. This work can lead to designing a wavelength sensitive detector which is efficient even in low intensities.

2014: First demonstration of plasmonic GaN quantum cascade detectors with enhanced efficiency at normal incidence.
Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and measured the first plasmon-assisted normal incidence GaN/AlN quantum cascade detector (QCD) making use of the surface plasmon resonance of a two-dimensional nanohole Au array integrated on top of the detector absorption region. The spectral response of the detector at room temperature is peaked at the plasmon resonance of 1.82 μm. We show that the presence of the nanohole array induces an absolute enhancement of the responsivity by a factor of ~30 over that of the bare device at normal incidence and by a factor of 3 with respect to illumination by the 45° polished side facet. We show that this significant improvement arises from two phenomena, namely, the polarization rotation of the impinging light from tangential to normal induced by the plasmonic structure and from the enhancement of the absorption cross-section per quantum well due to the near-field optical intensity of the plasmonic wave.

2014: Comparison of Simulation and Measurement of Gate Leakage Current in Metal/Al2O3/GaN/AlGaN/AlN/GaN Capacitors
Abstract: We compare the simulations and measurements of gate leakage current in metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors fabricated on standard AlGaN/GaN transistor layers. In the simulations, a fixed charge density at the interface between the Al2O3 layer and the GaN cap layer was assumed for simplicity. The fixed charge layer (which depends on bias and device history) was obtained from capacitance-voltage measurements. The calculated tunneling current due to field emission from localized states in the GaN cap layer agreed with the experimental results. No additional leakage mechanisms had to be invoked.

2013: GaN/AlGaN waveguide quantum cascade photodetectors at λ ≈ 1.55 μm with enhanced responsivity and ∼40 GHz frequency bandwidth
Abstract: We report on ultrafast GaN/AlGaN waveguide quantum cascade detectors with a peak detection wavelength of 1.5 μm. Mesa devices with a size of 7 × 7 and 10 × 10 μm2 have been fabricated with radio-frequency impedance-matched access lines. A strong enhancement of the responsivity is reported by illuminating the waveguide facet, with respect to illumination of the top surface. The room temperature responsivity is estimated to be higher than 9.5 ± 2 and 7.8 ± 2 mA/W, while the −3dB frequency response is extracted to be 42 and 37.4 GHz for 7 × 7 and 10 × 10 μm2 devices, respectively.

2013: Measuring the refractive index around intersubband transition resonance in GaN/AlN multi quantum wells.
Abstract: We present the direct measurement of the refractive index distribution (spectral dispersion) arising from an intersubband transition in GaN/AlN multi quantum wells structure. The measurement is carried out through a novel interferometric technique. The measured interferogram yields a change in the refractive index varying from -5 × 10(-3) to 6 × 10(-3) as a function of the wavelength, introduced by the intersubband resonance at 1.5 µm. These results compare well with those derived using Kramers-Kronig transform of the measured absorption spectrum.

2013: Non-polar m-plane intersubband based InGaN/(Al)GaN quantum well infrared photodetectors
Abstract: We demonstrate intersuband InGaN/(Al)GaN quantum well infrared photodetectors grown on a free standing non-polar m-plane GaN substrate. The devices are grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition and exhibit TM-polarized photocurrent at peak wavelengths of 7.5 and 9.3 μm at temperature of 14 K. Based on the experimental data of intersubband and interband transition energies and 8-band k · p Schrodinger-Poisson solver calculations, we were able to estimate the conduction band offset to valence band offset discontinuity ratio (ΔEc:ΔEv) of 57:43 for In0.1Ga0.9N/GaN and 55:45, for In0.095GA0.905N/Al0.07Ga0.93N non-polar m-plane multi-quantum well structures.

2012: Photocurrent spectroscopy of intersubband transitions in GaInAsN/(Al)GaAs asymmetric quantum well infrared photodetectors
Abstract: We have studied the conduction band electronic level structure of GaInAsN/(Al)GaAs-based quantum well (QW) infrared photodetectors using intersubband photocurrent (PC) spectroscopy and dark current analysis. Photoluminescence and intersubband absorption were carried out as complementary spectroscopic techniques. Based on the observed transition energy, we associated the photocurrent peaks with electron excitations from bound states in the quantum wells to quasi-bound states in the continuum. A good agreement with the experimental results was obtained using a 10-band k · p model that took into account the inhomogeneous distribution of nitrogen atoms along the quantum well's growth direction.

2012: High performance horizontal gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors
Abstract: Semiconducting nanowires have been pointed out as one of the most promising building blocks for submicron electrical applications. These nanometer materials open new opportunities in the area of post-planar traditional metal–oxide–semiconductor devices. Herein, we demonstrate a new technique to fabricate horizontally suspended silicon nanowires with gate-all-around field-effect transistors. We present the design, fabrication and electrical measurements of a high performance transistor with high on current density (∼150 μA μm−1), high on/off current ratio (106), low threshold voltage (∼ − 0.4 V), low subthreshold slope (∼100 mV /dec) and high transconductance (gm ∼ 9.5 μS). These high performance characteristics were possible due to the tight electrostatic coupling of the surrounding gate, which significantly reduced the Schottky-barrier effective height, as was confirmed experimentally in this study.

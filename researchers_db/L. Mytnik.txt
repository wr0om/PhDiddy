2023: Stochastic equations with singular drift driven by fractional Brownian motion
Abstract: We consider stochastic differential equation $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d W_t^H, $$ where the drift $b$ is either a measure or an integrable function, and $W^H$ is a $d$-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. For the case where $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p\in[1,\infty]$ we show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the condition $$ \frac{d}p<\frac1H-1, $$ which is an extension of the Krylov-R\"ockner condition (2005) to the fractional case. We construct a counter-example showing optimality of this condition. If $b$ is a Radon measure, particularly the delta measure, we prove weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition $H<\frac1{d+1}$. We also show strong well-posedness of solutions to this equation under certain conditions. To establish these results, we utilize the stochastic sewing technique and develop a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma.

2022: Longtime behavior of completely positively correlated Symbiotic Branching Model
Abstract: We study the longtime behavior of a continuous state Symbiotic Branching Model (SBM). SBM can be seen as a unified model generalizing the Stepping Stone Model, Mutually Catalytic Branching Processes, and the Parabolic Anderson Model. It was introduced by Etheridge and Fleischmann in 2004. The key parameter in these models is the local correlation $\rho$ between the driving Brownian Motions. The longtime behavior of all SBM exhibits a dichotomy between coexistence and non-coexistence of the two populations depending on the recurrence and transience of the migration and also in many cases on the branching rate. The most significant gap in the understanding of the longtime behavior of SBM is for positive correlations in the transient regime. In this article we give a precise description of the longtime behavior of the SBM with $\rho=1$ with not necessarily identical initial conditions.

2022: Exceptional times for the instantaneous propagation of superprocess
Abstract: For a Dawson-Watanabe superprocess $X$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, it is shown in Perkins (1990) that if the underlying spatial motion belongs to a certain class of L\'evy processes that admit jumps, then with probability one the closed support of $X_t$ is the whole space for almost all $t>0$ before extinction, the so-called ``instantaneous propagation'' property. In this paper for superprocesses on $\mathbb{R}^1$ whose spatial motion is the symmetric stable process of index $\alpha \in (0,2/3)$, we prove that there exist exceptional times at which the support is compact and nonempty. Moreover, we show that the set of exceptional times is dense with full Hausdorff dimension. Besides, we prove that near extinction, the support of the superprocess is concentrated arbitrarily close to the distinction point, thus upgrading the corresponding results in Tribe (1992) from $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$ to $\alpha \in (0,2/3)$, and we further show that the set of such exceptional times also admits a full Hausdorff dimension.

2022: On the coming down from infinity of coalescing Brownian motions
Abstract: Consider a system of Brownian particles on the real line where each pair of particles coalesces at a certain rate according to their intersection local time. Assume that there are infinitely many initial particles in the system. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the number of particles to come down from infinity. We also identify the rate of this coming down from infinity for different initial configurations.

2021: Effect of small noise on the speed of reaction-diffusion equations with non-Lipschitz drift
Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued solution $(u_{t,x}:t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb R)$ to the one dimensional stochastic reaction diffusion equation with Wright-Fisher noise \[\partial_t u= \partial_x^2 u + f(u) + \epsilon \sqrt{u(1-u)} \dot W.\] Here, $W$ is a space-time white noise, $\epsilon>0$ is the noise strength, and $f$ is a continuous function on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\sup_{z\in [0,1]}|f(z)|/ \sqrt{z(1-z)}<\infty.$ We assume the initial data satisfies $1 - u_{0,-x} = u_{0,x} = 0$ for $x$ large enough. Recently, it was proved in (Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{384} (2021), no. 2) that the front of $u_t$ propagates with a finite deterministic speed $V_{f,\epsilon}$, and under slightly stronger conditions on $f$, the asymptotic behavior of $V_{f,\epsilon}$ was derived as the noise strength $\epsilon$ approaches $\infty$. In this paper we complement the above result by obtaining the asymptotic behavior of $V_{f,\epsilon}$ as the noise strength $\epsilon$ approaches $0$: for a given $p\in [1/2,1)$, if $f(z)$ is non-negative and is comparable to $z^p$ for sufficiently small $z$, then $V_{f,\epsilon}$ is comparable to $\epsilon^{-2\frac{1-p}{1+p}}$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$.

2020: Well‐posedness of stochastic heat equation with distributional drift and skew stochastic heat equation
Abstract: We study stochastic reaction–diffusion equation ∂tut(x)=12∂xx2ut(x)+b(ut(x))+Ẇt(x),t>0,x∈D$$\begin{equation*} \partial _tu_t(x)=\frac{1}{2} \partial ^2_{xx}u_t(x)+b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x), \quad t>0,\, x\in {D} \end{equation*}$$where b$b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space Bq,∞β(R)$\mathcal {B}^\beta _{q,\infty }(\mathbb {R})$ , D⊂R${D}\subset \mathbb {R}$ and Ẇ$\dot{W}$ is a space‐time white noise on R+×D$\mathbb {R}_+\times {D}$ . We introduce a notion of a solution to this equation and obtain existence and uniqueness of a strong solution whenever β−1/q⩾−1$\beta -1/q\geqslant -1$ , β>−1$\beta >-1$ and q∈[1,∞]$q\in [1,\infty ]$ . This class includes equations with b$b$ being measures, in particular, b=δ0$b=\delta _0$ which corresponds to the skewed stochastic heat equation. For β−1/q>−3/2$\beta -1/q > -3/2$ , we obtain existence of a weak solution. Our results extend the work of Bass and Chen (2001) to the framework of stochastic partial differential equations and generalize the results of Gyöngy and Pardoux (1993) to distributional drifts. To establish these results, we exploit the regularization effect of the white noise through a new strategy based on the stochastic sewing lemma introduced in Lê (2020).

2020: Absolute continuity of the super-Brownian motion with infinite mean
Abstract: In this work we prove that for any dimension $d\geq 1$ and any $\gamma \in (0,1)$ super-Brownian motion corresponding to the log-Laplace equation \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \frac{\partial v(t,x)}{\partial t } & = \frac{1}{2}\bigtriangleup v(t,x) + v^\gamma (t,x) ,\: (t,x) \in \mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}^d,\\ v(0,x)&= f(x) \end{split} \end{equation*} is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure at any fixed time $t>0$. Our proof is based on properties of solutions of the \LL\ equation. 
We also prove that when initial datum $v(0,\cdot)$ is a finite, non-zero measure, then the \LL\ equation has a unique, continuous solution. Moreover this solution continuously depends on initial data.

2020: The distance between the two BBM leaders
Abstract: We study the distance between the two rightmost particles in branching Brownian motion. Derrida and the second author have shown that the long-time limit d 12 of this random variable can be expressed in terms of PDEs related to the Fisher–KPP equation. We use such a representation to determine the sharp asymptotics of a)$?> P(d12>a) as a → +∞. These tail asymptotics were previously known to ‘exponential order;’ we discover an algebraic correction to this behavior.

2019: General Contact Process with Rapid Stirring
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of an interacting particle system evolving on the lattice $Z^{d}$ for $d\ge 3$. The model is known as the contact process with rapid stirring. The process starts with a single particle at the origin. Each particle may die, jump to a neighboring site if it is vacant or split. In the case of splitting, one of the offspring takes the place of the parent while the other, the newborn particle, is sent to another site in $Z^{d}$ according to a certain distribution; if the newborn particle lands on an occupied site, its birth is suppressed. We study the asymptotic behavior of the critical branching rate as the jumping rate (also known as the stirring rate) approaches infinity.

2018: The Aldous chain on cladograms in the diffusion limit
Abstract: In [Ald00], Aldous investigates a symmetric Markov chain on cladograms and gives bounds on its mixing and relaxation times. The latter bound was sharpened in [Sch02]. In the present paper we encode cladograms as binary, algebraic measure trees and show that this Markov chain on cladograms with fixed number of leaves converges in distribution as the number of leaves goes to infinity. We give a rigorous construction of the limit, whose existence was conjectured by Aldous and which we therefore refer to as Aldous diffusion, as a solution of a well-posed martingale problem. We show that the Aldous diffusion is a Feller process with continuous paths, and the algebraic measure Brownian CRT is its unique invariant distribution. Furthermore, we consider the vector of the masses of the three subtrees connected to a sampled branch point. In the Brownian CRT, its annealed law is known to be the Dirichlet distribution. Here, we give an explicit expression for the infinitesimal evolution of its quenched law under the Aldous diffusion.

2018: On the topological boundary of the range of super-Brownian motion
Abstract: We show that if $\partial\mathcal{R}$ is the boundary of the range of super-Brownian motion and dim denotes Hausdorff dimension, then with probability one, for any open set $U$, $\partial\mathcal{R}\cap U\neq\emptyset$ implies $$\text{dim}(U\cap\partial\mathcal{R})=\begin{cases} 4-2\sqrt2\approx1.17&\text{ if }d=2\\ \frac{9-\sqrt{17}}{2}\approx 2.44&\text{ if }d=3. \end{cases}$$ This improves recent results of the last two authors (arxiv:1711.03486) by working with the actual topological boundary, rather than the boundary of the zero set of the local time, and establishing a local result for the dimension.

2018: Strong existence and uniqueness for stable stochastic differential equations with distributional drift
Abstract: We consider the stochastic differential equation $$ dX_t = b(X_t) dt + dL_t,$$ where the drift $b$ is a generalized function and $L$ is a symmetric one dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes, $\alpha \in (1, 2)$. We define the notion of solution to this equation and establish strong existence and uniqueness whenever $b$ belongs to the Besov--H\"{o}lder space $\mathcal{C}^\beta$ for $\beta >1/2-\alpha/2$.

2017: Infinite rate symbiotic branching on the real line: The tired frogs model
Abstract: Consider a population of infinitesimally small frogs on the real line. Initially the frogs on the positive half-line are dormant while those on the negative half-line are awake and move according to the heat flow. At the interface, the incoming wake frogs try to wake up the dormant frogs and succeed with a probability proportional to their amount among the total amount of involved frogs at the specific site. Otherwise, the incoming frogs also fall asleep. This frog model is a special case of the infinite rate symbiotic branching process on the real line with different motion speeds for the two types. 
We construct this frog model as the limit of approximating processes and compute the structure of jumps. We show that our frog model can be described by a stochastic partial differential equation on the real line with a jump type noise.

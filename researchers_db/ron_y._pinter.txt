2020: A Note on GRegNetSim: A Tool for the Discrete Simulation and Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks
Abstract: Discrete simulations of genetic regulatory networks have been used to study subsystems of yeast successfully. Existing models underling these simulations are based on specific transition functions, which determine the node states in the network. However, implementations of existing models are not freely available and support only a textual user interface (TUI). Additionally, even if an implementation that supports a graphic user interface (GUI) were available, the computations necessary to analyze the simulations would still have to be done manually. Furthermore, the usage of different transition functions by existing models suggests that an enriched model is needed. We developed a software tool, called GRegNetSim, that allows the end-user (a biologist) to describe genetic regulatory networks graphically. The input is displayed visually via Cytoscape (an open-source platform for the representation and analysis of biological networks). The user can specify various transition functions at different nodes of the network, supporting, for example, threshold and gradient effects, thereby analyzing the network under a variety of modes dictated by these functions. GRegNetSim displays the relationship between the inputs and the mode of behavior of the network in a graphic form that is easy to interpret. Furthermore, it automatically extracts statistical data such as the percentage of simulations that reached a steady state or the percentage of simulations that terminated with a certain state. The discrete simulations performed by GRegNetSim can be used to elucidate and predict the behavior, structure, and properties of genetic regulatory networks in a unified manner. GRegNetSim is implemented as a Cytoscape App. Installation files, examples, and source code, along with a detailed user guide, are freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/gregnetsim/.

2017: GRegNetSim : A Tool for the Discrete Simulation and Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks
Abstract: Background: Discrete simulations of genetic regulatory networks have been used to study subsystems of yeast successfully. However, implementations of the two models underlying these simulations do not support a graphic interface, are not freely available, and require computations necessary to analyze their results to be done manually. Furthermore, differences between these two models suggest that an enriched model, encompassing both existing models, is needed. Results: We developed a software tool, called GRegNetSim, that allows the end-user (a biologist) to describe genetic regulatory networks graphically. The input is graphic (as an input to Cytoscape, an open-source platform for the representation and analysis of biological networks). The user can specify various transition functions at different nodes of the network, supporting, for example, threshold and gradient effects, and then apply the network to a variety of inputs. GRegNetSim displays the relationship between the inputs and the mode of behavior of the network in a graphic form that is easy to interpret. Furthermore, it can automatically extract statistical data necessary to analyze the simulations. Conclusions: The discrete simulations performed by GRegNetSim can be used to elucidate and predict the behavior, structure and properties of genetic regulatory networks in a unified manner. GRegNetSim is implemented as a Cytoscape App. Installation files, examples and source code, along with a detailed user guide, are freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/gregnetsim/.

2013: Interferon-Beta Induces Distinct Gene Expression Response Patterns in Human Monocytes versus T cells
Abstract: Background Monocytes, which are key players in innate immunity, are outnumbered by neutrophils and lymphocytes among peripheral white blood cells. The cytokine interferon-β (IFN-β) is widely used as an immunomodulatory drug for multiple sclerosis and its functional pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been previously described. The aim of the present study was to identify novel, cell-specific IFN-β functions and pathways in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-activated monocytes that may have been missed in studies using PBMCs. Methodology/Principal Findings Whole genome gene expression profiles of human monocytes and T cells were compared following in vitro priming to TNF-α and overnight exposure to IFN-β. Statistical analyses of the gene expression data revealed a cell-type-specific change of 699 transcripts, 667 monocyte-specific transcripts, 21 T cell-specific transcripts and 11 transcripts with either a difference in the response direction or a difference in the magnitude of response. RT-PCR revealed a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), exhibiting responses to IFN-β that are modulated by TNF-α in monocytes, such as RIPK2 and CD83, but not in T cells or PBMCs. Known IFN-β promoter response elements, such as ISRE, were enriched in T cell DEGs but not in monocyte DEGs. The overall directionality of the gene expression regulation by IFN-β was different in T cells and monocytes, with up-regulation more prevalent in T cells, and a similar extent of up and down-regulation recorded in monocytes. Conclusions By focusing on the response of distinct cell types and by evaluating the combined effects of two cytokines with pro and anti-inflammatory activities, we were able to present two new findings First, new IFN-β response pathways and genes, some of which were monocytes specific; second, a cell-specific modulation of the IFN-β response transcriptome by TNF-α.

2013: Orders Induced by Segments in Floorplans and (2 - 14 - 3, 3 - 41 - 2)-Avoiding Permutations
Abstract: A floorplan is a tiling of a rectangle by rectangles. There are natural ways to order the elements - rectangles and segments - of a floorplan. Ackerman, Barequet and Pinter studied a pair of orders induced by neighborhood relations between rectangles, and obtained a natural bijection between these pairs and $(2 - 41 - 3, 3 - 14 - 2)$-avoiding permutations, also known as (reduced) Baxter permutations. In the present paper, we first perform a similar study for a pair of orders induced by neighborhood relations between segments  of a floorplan. We obtain a natural bijection between these pairs and another family of permutations, namely $(2 - 14 - 3, 3 - 41 - 2)$-avoiding permutations. Then, we investigate relations between the two kinds of pairs of orders - and, correspondingly, between $(2 - 41 - 3, 3 - 14 - 2)$- and $(2 - 14 - 3, 3 - 41 - 2)$-avoiding permutations. In particular, we prove that the superposition of both permutations gives a complete Baxter permutation (originally called $w$-admissible by Baxter and Joichi in the sixties). In other words, $(2 - 14 - 3, 3 - 41 - 2)$-avoiding permutations are the hidden part of complete Baxter permutations. We enumerate these permutations. To our knowledge, the characterization of these permutations in terms of forbidden patterns and their enumeration are both new results. Finally, we also study the special case of the so-called guillotine floorplans.

2012: General \ Time Polynomial Considers Limited Complexity Space ? Weights ?
Abstract: In this article we address two pattern matching problems which have important applications to bioinformatics. First we address the topology-free query problem: Given a set of labels L, a multiset P of labels from L, a graph H = (VH , EH) and a function LabelH : VH → 2, we need to find a subtree S of H which is an occurrence of P . We provide a fixed-parameter algorithm with parameter k = |P | whose time complexity is O∗(2k) and whose space complexity is polynomial. We also consider three variations of this problem. Then we address the alignment query problem: Given two labeled graphs P and H, we need to find a subgraph S of H whose alignment with P is the best among all such subgraphs. We present two algorithms where P and H belong to certain families of DAGs whose time complexities are polynomial and are less restrictive than algorithms that are available today for alignment queries. Topology-free and alignment queries provide means to study the function and evolution of biological networks, and today, with the increasing amount of knowledge regarding biological networks, they are extremely relevant.

2012: Dotted interval graphs
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of interval graphs, which we call Dotted Interval Graphs (DIG). A dotted interval graph is an intersection graph of arithmetic progressions (dotted intervals). Coloring of dotted interval graphs naturally arises in the context of high throughput genotyping. We study the properties of dotted interval graphs, with a focus on coloring. We show that any graph is a DIG, but that <i>DIG<sub>d</sub></i> graphs, that is, DIGs in which the arithmetic progressions have a jump of at most <i>d</i>, form a strict hierarchy. We show that coloring <i>DIG<sub>d</sub></i> graphs is NP-complete even for <i>d</i> = 2. For any fixed <i>d</i>, we provide a 5/6<i>d</i> + <i>o</i>(<i>d</i>) approximation for the coloring of <i>DIG<sub>d</sub></i> graphs. Finally, we show that finding the maximal clique in <i>DIG<sub>d</sub></i> graphs is fixed parameter tractable in <i>d</i>.

2010: Orders induced by segments in floorplan partitions and (2-14-3,3-41-2)-avoiding permutations
Abstract: A floorplan is a tiling of a rectangle by rectangles. There are natural ways to order the elements---rectangles and segments---of a floorplan. Ackerman, Barequet and Pinter studied a pair of orders induced by neighborhood relations between rectangles, and obtained a natural bijection between these pairs and (2-41-3, 3-14-2)-avoiding permutations, also known as (reduced) Baxter permutations. In the present paper, we first perform a similar study for a pair of orders induced by neighborhood relations between segments of a floorplan. We obtain a natural bijection between these pairs and another family of permutations, namely (2-14-3, 3-41-2)-avoiding permutations. Then, we investigate relations between the two kinds of pairs of orders---and, correspondingly, between (2-41-3, 3-14-2)- and (2-14-3, 3-41-2)-avoiding permutations. In particular, we prove that the superposition of both permutations gives a complete Baxter permutation (originally called w-admissible, by Baxter and Joichi in the sixties). In other words, (2-14-3, 3-41-2)-avoiding permutations are the hidden part of complete Baxter permutations. We enumerate these permutations.

2009: CONDITIONAL PATHWAY INTEGRATION
Abstract: ion, e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, and regulation, each providing a partial perspective on the biological issues at hand. Currently, the descriptions of individual pathways is stored in several – both public as well as commercial – databases (such as KEGG , MetaCyc 4, , iPath , Reactome , and STKE ; see 8 for a review) using a variety of representations and presentation mechanisms; a wealth of information can also be found in the literature (in e.g. PubMed , where typically each paper describes the properties of a specific pathway or subsystem. Consequently, it is nearly impossible for a life science researcher to glean a comprehensive and integrative view of several pathways under one framework, which is a clear need for the systematic study of biological processes beyond encapsulated, specific functions. For example, when trying to elucidate drug response, it is critical to capture the impact of a substance (be it constitutive or administered) in its entirety. Examination of several pathways at the same time can enhance our understanding of the biological system under study. The pertinent pathways can be different, or be separate instances of the same pathway coming from various data sources, each emphasizing distinct aspects of the biological process. By combining these resources, we can recognize e.g. regulating factors in pathways and crosstalk between them. Such deep understanding of the biological systems can benefit in the investigation of e.g. positive response, resistance to treatment, and adverse drug reaction in pharmacogenetic studies . Thus we propose a method – and a tool that is based on it – for the integration of pathways reflecting inconsistencies among the data sources and producing a coherent subsystem, which – subsequently – can be analyzed by both static as well as dynamic methods and tools. For example, the latter type of analysis may consist of simulations of the resulting conditional pathway that can be now treated as one subsystem, assuming – of course – that the simulation engine can accommodate the richness of the conditional description, as is the case with several advanced analysis tools that have been devised recently, such as . The challenge of pathway integration is compounded by both biological as well as technical issues. It is well known that cells of different types and from distinct tissues under various environmental conditions have different gene expression profiles, which are the results of activating slightly different pathways . Activating factors also play an important role in protein modes and localization within a cell. Data inconsistency between different data sources, e.g. the same reaction being described differently, should not be forgotten either. Moreover, studied pathways are often divided into several sub-pathways due to technical limitations. Therefore, inappropriate cutoffs should also be taken into consideration. Hence, during pathway integration all of the abovementioned stumbling blocks should be accommodated. The commonly used abstraction of a biological pathway as a labeled directed graph is not expressive enough to reflect minor but potentially critical differences between them. Many of those differences, such as tissue, cell type, and cell condition, are expressed verbally by biologists but cannot be included in current representations. Thus we developed a conditional pathway algebra, in which a "simple" pathway graph is enriched both with new node types as well as additional edge types accompanied with various attributes. We provide a formal definition of the algebra and prove some of its properties, such as closure and commutativity, and demonstrate its lack of associativity. Of these the most important is closure, i.e. ensuring that the resulting pathway is always contained in the set of pathways to which further operations are applicable. The algebra is embodied in the Pathway Integration Environment (PIE) as a plugin for Cytoscape, a generalpurpose, open-source environment for the large scale integration of molecular interaction network data and its visualization . We applied PIE to all possible two-way as well as the three-way integration of three well characterized yeast signaling pathways: (i) Pheromone; (ii) Filamentous growth and (iii) High osmolarity glycerol pathways; the obtained results are confirmed in

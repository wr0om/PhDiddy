2023: Enhancing Strategic Planning of Projects: Selecting the Right Product Development Methodology
Abstract: The selection of an appropriate development methodology is a critical strategic decision when managing a New Product Development (NPD) project. However, accurately estimating project duration based on the chosen methodology remains a challenge. This paper addresses the limitations of existing models and proposes a novel NPD project model that allows for testing and evaluation of different product development strategies. The model considers Waterfall, Spiral, Agile, and Hybrid methodologies and provides system engineers and project managers with decision-making tools to determine the optimal strategy and understand associated tradeoffs. The model is validated using real projects from various organizations and methodologies. It incorporates stochastic variables, risk management, and dynamic resource allocation, while addressing both Waterfall and Agile methodologies. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by offering practical tools for system engineers and project managers for choosing development methodology, improving project duration estimation, and identifying critical processes and risks in NPD projects. The research results also provide a basis for further studies and can benefit researchers interested in systems engineering methodologies. The proposed model fills a gap in the literature by providing a validated NPD model to evaluate the impact of different product development methodologies on project duration.

2023: Balancing Project Schedule, Cost, and Value under Uncertainty: A Reinforcement Learning Approach
Abstract: Industrial projects are plagued by uncertainties, often resulting in both time and cost overruns. This research introduces an innovative approach, employing Reinforcement Learning (RL), to address three distinct project management challenges within a setting of uncertain activity durations. The primary objective is to identify stable baseline schedules. The first challenge encompasses the multimode lean project management problem, wherein the goal is to maximize a project’s value function while adhering to both due date and budget chance constraints. The second challenge involves the chance-constrained critical chain buffer management problem in a multimode context. Here, the aim is to minimize the project delivery date while considering resource constraints and duration-chance constraints. The third challenge revolves around striking a balance between the project value and its net present value (NPV) within a resource-constrained multimode environment. To tackle these three challenges, we devised mathematical programming models, some of which were solved optimally. Additionally, we developed competitive RL-based algorithms and verified their performance against established benchmarks. Our RL algorithms consistently generated schedules that compared favorably with the benchmarks, leading to higher project values and NPVs and shorter schedules while staying within the stakeholders’ risk thresholds. The potential beneficiaries of this research are project managers and decision-makers who can use this approach to generate an efficient frontier of optimal project plans.

2022: Using an Artificial Neural Network for Improving the Prediction of Project Duration
Abstract: One of the most challenging tasks in project management is estimating the duration of a project. The unknowns that accompany projects, the different risks, the uniqueness of each project, and the differences between organizations’ culture and management techniques, hinder the ability to build one project duration prediction tool that can fit all types of projects and organizations. When machine learning (ML) techniques are used for project duration prediction, the challenge is even greater, as each organization has a different dataset structure, different features, and different quality of data. This hinders the ability to create one ML model that fits all types of organizations. This paper presents a new dynamic ML tool for improving the prediction accuracy of project duration. The tool is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) which is automatically adapted and optimized to different types of prediction methods and different datasets. The tool trains the ANN model multiple times with different architectures and uses a genetic algorithm to eventually choose the architecture which gives the most accurate prediction results. The validation process of the prediction accuracy is performed by using real-life project datasets supplied by two different organizations which have different project management approaches, different project types, and different project features. The results show that the proposed tool significantly improved the prediction accuracy for both organizations despite the major differences in the size, type, and structure of their datasets.

2021: The Influence of Competition on New Product Development Project Planning Decisions
Abstract: In a typical new product development (NPD) project, there are many alternatives, ranging from incremental changes or re-engineering of an existing product in order to compete better in an existing market, to breakthrough thinking and the development of a new product using new technologies that satisfy the needs and expectations of customers in new markets. We tested the hypothesis that competition influences the decisions of entrepreneurs managing NPD projects. The findings presented in this paper are based on a controlled experiment conducted in several project management courses using a simulation game. The results reveal that a competitive environment in which participants compete for the same customers tends to impact the planning of NPD projects. The paper contributes to the managerial practice by offering integration of “What if?” analysis in the planning phase of NPD projects. It can assist entrepreneurs to evaluate the tradeoffs of the feasible alternatives in a noncompetitive environment, and explain how market conditions, such as competitor entry behavior, affect the project plan. A decision on the best project plan, among all the feasible project plans, is based on management strategy that takes into account the level of competition along with the uncertainty in the technology, market, and environment. The game, combined with a simulation-based training tool, used in this study, offer an opportunity to develop and to try different alternatives for the management of NPD projects without risking the consequences of project failure.

2021: The compounding effect of multiple disruptions on construction projects
Abstract: Abstract A construction project life cycle model that simulates the effect of disruptions on labor productivity is in the center of this research. The model (which is based on a model developed at the MIT), is used in order to find the parameters which contribute to the stability and robustness of labor productivity under disruptions. The study included analysis of randomly generated 1,363 different projects and 68,150 simulated scenarios to measure the effect of disruptions in projects on the labor productivity It demonstrates the ripple effect, an exponential increase in project duration caused by a high volume of disruptions, and points out the factors and parameters that influence it. The four hypotheses in this study were tested using a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The novelty of this paper is by finding the parameters that control the ripple effect, we were able to analyze the effect of the multiple disruptions on the project duration and identify the project properties that have the most significant influence. The findings of this study can help managers to reduce the project’s risks and increase its stability.

2020: Simulation-Based Training: From a Traditional Course to Remote Learning - the COVID-19 Effect
Abstract: The University of Bergamo switched from regular classes to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic during March 2020, without leaving to the students the chance to meet their teachers in the traditional setting even once. As such, this context represents a unique opportunity to compare the traditional courses, held in the years before, with remote learning. In this paper, we focus on the lessons learned from switching a project management course that combines traditional lectures with Simulation-Based Training (SBT) to an online course with the same structure, same curriculum and the same teaching team. Lessons learned are based on the opportunity to compare the two methods of teaching and their learning outcomes. Based on the analysis, conclusions about the future of this course and similar courses are presented.

2019: Measuring the success of Lean and Agile projects: Are cost, time, scope and quality equally important?
Abstract: This study presents the results of a survey conducted among managers from organizations that use Agile/Lean methodology for new product development. The study focused on the way these organizations measure the success of their projects. We found that most of the Agile/Lean projects failed to achieve the top criterion their organizations selected to evaluate the project success. We propose some tools designed to increase the probability of success based on the criteria selected by Lean and Agile project managers.

2017: Simulation Training: Evaluating the Instructor’s Contribution to a Wizard of Oz Simulator in Obstetrics and Gynecology Ultrasound Training
Abstract: Background Workplaces today demand graduates who are prepared with field-specific knowledge, advanced social skills, problem-solving skills, and integration capabilities. Meeting these goals with didactic learning (DL) is becoming increasingly difficult. Enhanced training methods that would better prepare tomorrow’s graduates must be more engaging and game-like, such as feedback based e-learning or simulation-based training, while saving time. Empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of advanced learning methods is lacking. Objective quantitative research comparing advanced training methods with DL is sparse. Objectives This quantitative study assessed the effectiveness of a computerized interactive simulator coupled with an instructor who monitored students’ progress and provided Web-based immediate feedback. Methods A low-cost, globally accessible, telemedicine simulator, developed at the Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel—was used. A previous study in the field of interventional cardiology, evaluating the efficacy of the simulator to enhanced learning via knowledge exams, presented promising results of average scores varying from 94% after training and 54% before training (n=20) with P<.001. Two independent experiments involving obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) physicians and senior ultrasound sonographers, with 32 subjects, were conducted using a new interactive concept of the WOZ (Wizard of OZ) simulator platform. The contribution of an instructor to learning outcomes was evaluated by comparing students’ knowledge before and after each interactive instructor-led session as well as after fully automated e-learning in the field of Ob-Gyn. Results from objective knowledge tests were analyzed using hypothesis testing and model fitting. Results A significant advantage (P=.01) was found in favor of the WOZ training approach. Content type and training audience were not significant. Conclusions This study evaluated the contribution of an integrated teaching environment using a computerized interactive simulator, with an instructor providing immediate Web-based immediate feedback to trainees. Involvement of an instructor in the simulation-based training process provided better learning outcomes that varied training content and trainee populations did not affect the overall learning gains.

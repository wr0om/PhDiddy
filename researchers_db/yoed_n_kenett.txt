2025: We're Different, We're the Same: Creative Homogeneity Across LLMs
Abstract: Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an LLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of"creative"outputs.

2025: Applying Text Mining to Analyze Human Question Asking in Creativity Research
Abstract: Creativity relates to the ability to generate novel and effective ideas in the areas of interest. How are such creative ideas generated? One possible mechanism that supports creative ideation and is gaining increased empirical attention is by asking questions. Question asking is a likely cognitive mechanism that allows defining problems, facilitating creative problem solving. However, much is unknown about the exact role of questions in creativity. This work presents an attempt to apply text mining methods to measure the cognitive potential of questions, taking into account, among others, (a) question type, (b) question complexity, and (c) the content of the answer. This contribution summarizes the history of question mining as a part of creativity research, along with the natural language processing methods deemed useful or helpful in the study. In addition, a novel approach is proposed, implemented, and applied to five datasets. The experimental results obtained are comprehensively analyzed, suggesting that natural language processing has a role to play in creative research.

2025: Originality in scientific titles and abstracts can predict citation count
Abstract: In this research-in-progress paper, we apply a computational measure correlating with originality from creativity science: Divergent Semantic Integration (DSI), to a selection of 99,557 scientific abstracts and titles selected from the Web of Science. We observe statistically significant differences in DSI between subject and field of research, and a slight rise in DSI over time. We model the base 10 logarithm of the citation count after 5 years with DSI and find a statistically significant positive correlation in all fields of research with an adjusted $R^2$ of 0.13.

2024: The role of alpha oscillations in free‐ and goal‐directed semantic associations
Abstract: Abstract Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in several higher‐order cognitive functions, especially selective attention, working memory, semantic memory, and creative thinking. Nonetheless, we still know very little about the role of alpha in the generation of more remote semantic associations, which is key to creative and semantic cognition. Furthermore, it remains unclear how these oscillations are shaped by the intention to “be creative,” which is the case in most creativity tasks. We aimed to address these gaps in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we compared alpha oscillatory activity (using a method which distinguishes genuine oscillatory activity from transient events) during the generation of free associations which were more vs. less distant from a given concept. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings and also compared alpha oscillatory activity when people were generating free associations versus associations with the instruction to be creative (i.e. goal‐directed). We found that alpha was consistently higher during the generation of more distant semantic associations, in both experiments. This effect was widespread, involving areas in both left and right hemispheres. Importantly, the instruction to be creative seems to increase alpha phase synchronisation from left to right temporal brain areas, suggesting that intention to be creative changed the flux of information in the brain, likely reflecting an increase in top‐down control of semantic search processes. We conclude that goal‐directed generation of remote associations relies on top‐down mechanisms compared to when associations are freely generated.

2024: The Art of Creative Inquiry—From Question Asking to Prompt Engineering
Abstract: As artificial intelligence and natural language processing methods rapidly develop, communication plays a pivotal role in every‐day interactions. In this theoretical paper, we explore the overlap and commonalities between question‐asking and prompt engineering. While seemingly distinct, these processes share a common foundation in essential skills like creativity, critical thinking, and cognitive flexibility. We contend that prompt engineering, the art of crafting cues for language models, and question‐asking, the skill of formulating inquiries, form a symbiotic relationship. Delving into question complexity through Bloom's taxonomy and diverse types of questions, we propose strategies for not only efficient but also engaging prompt design. Our theoretical contribution emphasizes the dynamic role of creativity in both processes, offering intriguing perspectives on human–machine interactions and advancing our understanding of language models and communication skills.

2024: Conceptual structure of emotions.
Abstract: Theories of semantic organization have historically prioritized investigation of concrete concepts pertaining to inanimate objects and natural kinds. As a result, accounts of the conceptual representation of emotions have almost exclusively focused on their juxtaposition with concrete concepts. The present study aims to fill this gap by deriving a large set of normative feature data for emotion concepts and assessing similarities and differences between the featural representation of emotion, nonemotion abstract, and concrete concepts. We hypothesized that differences between the experience of emotions (e.g., happiness and sadness) and the experience of other abstract concepts (e.g., equality and tyranny), specifically regarding the relative importance of interoceptive states, might drive distinctions in the dimensions along which emotion concepts are represented. We also predicted, based on constructionist views of emotion, that emotion concepts might demonstrate more variability in their representation than concrete and other abstract concepts. Participants listed features which we coded into discrete categories and contrasted the feature distributions across conceptual types. Analyses revealed statistically significant differences in the distribution of features among the category types by condition. We also examined variability in the features generated, finding that, contrary to expectation, emotion concepts were associated with less variability. Our results reflect subtle differences between the structure of emotion concepts and the structure of, not only concrete concepts, but also other abstract concepts. We interpret these findings in the context of our sample, which was restricted to native English speakers, and discuss the importance of validating these findings across speakers of different languages.

2024: An entropy modulation theory of creative exploration.
Abstract: Compared to individuals who are rated as less creative, higher creative individuals tend to produce ideas more quickly and with more novelty-what we call faster-and-further phenomenology. This has traditionally been explained either as supporting an associative theory-based on differences in the structure of cognitive representations-or as supporting an executive theory-based on the principle that higher creative individuals utilize cognitive control to navigate their cognitive representations differently. Though extensive research demonstrates evidence of differences in semantic structure, structural explanations are limited in their ability to formally explain faster-and-further phenomenology. At the same time, executive abilities also correlate with creativity, but formal process models explaining how they contribute to faster-and-further phenomenology are lacking. Here, we introduce entropy modulation theory which integrates structure and process-based creativity accounts. Relying on a broad set of evidence, entropy modulation theory assumes that the difference between lower and higher creative individuals lies in the executive modulation of entropy during cognitive search (e.g., memory retrieval). With retrieval targets racing to reach an activation threshold, activation magnitude and variance both independently enhance the entropy of target retrieval and increase retrieval speed, reproducing the faster-and-further phenomenology. Thus, apparent differences in semantic structure can be produced via an entropy modulating retrieval process, which tunes cognitive entropy to mediate cognitive flexibility and the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

2024: Mapping the Memory Structure of High-Knowledge Students: A Longitudinal Semantic Network Analysis
Abstract: Standard learning assessments like multiple-choice questions measure what students know but not how their knowledge is organized. Recent advances in cognitive network science provide quantitative tools for modeling the structure of semantic memory, revealing key learning mechanisms. In two studies, we examined the semantic memory networks of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course. In Study 1, we administered a cumulative multiple-choice test of psychology knowledge, the Intro Psych Test, at the end of the course. To estimate semantic memory networks, we administered two verbal fluency tasks: domain-specific fluency (naming psychology concepts) and domain-general fluency (naming animals). Based on their performance on the Intro Psych Test, we categorized students into a high-knowledge or low-knowledge group, and compared their semantic memory networks. Study 1 (N = 213) found that the high-knowledge group had semantic memory networks that were more clustered, with shorter distances between concepts—across both the domain-specific (psychology) and domain-general (animal) categories—compared to the low-knowledge group. In Study 2 (N = 145), we replicated and extended these findings in a longitudinal study, collecting data near the start and end of the semester. In addition to replicating Study 1, we found the semantic memory networks of high-knowledge students became more interconnected over time, across both domain-general and domain-specific categories. These findings suggest that successful learners show a distinct semantic memory organization—characterized by high connectivity and short path distances between concepts—highlighting the utility of cognitive network science for studying variation in student learning.

2024: Connector hubs in semantic network contribute to creative thinking.
Abstract: Semantic memory offers a rich repository of raw materials (e.g., various concepts and connections between concepts) for creative thinking, represented as a semantic network. Similar to other networks, the semantic network exhibits a modular structure characterized by modules with dense internal connections and sparse connections between them. This organizational principle facilitates the routine storage and retrieval of information but may impede creativity. The present study investigated the effect of hub concepts with varying connection patterns on creative thinking from the perspective of a modular structured semantic network. By analyzing a large-scale semantic network, connector hubs (C-hubs) and provincial hubs (P-hubs) were identified based on their intra- and intermodule connections. These hubs were used as cue words in the alternative uses task, a widely used measure of creative thinking. Across four experiments, behavioral and neural evidence indicated that C-hubs facilitate the generation of more novel and remote ideas compared to P-hubs. However, this effect is predominantly observed in the early stage of the creative thinking process, involving changes in brain activation and functional connectivity in core regions of the default mode network and the frontoparietal network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, and precuneus. Neural findings suggest that the superior performance of C-hubs relies on stronger interactions between automatic spreading activation, controlled semantic retrieval, and attentional regulation of salient information. These results provide insight into how concepts with varying semantic connection patterns facilitate and constrain different stages of the creative thinking process through the modular structure of semantic network.

2024: How retrieval processes change with age: Exploring age differences in semantic network and retrieval dynamics.
Abstract: This study investigated the impact of age on semantic memory networks and retrieval dynamics using a single-list free recall paradigm, involving 318 participants. The younger group, with 175 participants aged 25-55 years (M = 46.68 years; SD = 10.69), and the older group, consisting of 143 participants aged 61-88 years (M = 68.71 years; SD = 6.09), completed a word recall test to assess delayed recall performance. Semantic memory networks were constructed from recall data by analyzing the co-occurrence and sequence of recalled words. We observed significant differences in network structure, where the older group displayed higher average shortest path length and modularity values, indicative of less integrated networks, while the younger group exhibited a higher clustering coefficient, suggesting a more interconnected network. In terms of retrieval dynamics, both groups showed a temporal contiguity effect with forward asymmetry. However, this effect was less pronounced in older adults. The study also identified participants that diverted from the average dynamic curves: one subgroup relied on nontemporal mechanisms, and the other employed a backward direction in memory search. Participants utilizing forward temporal associations demonstrated the highest recall performance. Overall, our findings suggest that lower free recall performance in older adults may be related to a diminished capacity to reinstate temporal context for retrieval and distinct differences in their semantic memory network structure. Specifically, older adults appear to exhibit networks with a less flexible, small-world-like structure. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).

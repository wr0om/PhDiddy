2023: Rare species of West Indian aspect in the Holocene of Liverpool Bay and their biogeographic and environmental significance
Abstract: The Gulf Stream, although not directly responsible for the mild, temperate climate of the British Isles, transports vast quantities of water across the North Atlantic Ocean. An extension of the Caribbean-Loop-Florida current system, this strong current cools and becomes more saline by evaporation as it flows NE across the North Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, it is able to transport benthic foraminifera across oceanic distances, the fauna around Bermuda containing many species described from the Caribbean Sea. Examining two cores taken from the shallow middle neritic Holocene Surface Sands Formation of the temperate Liverpool Bay, England, we found rare specimens of eight species recorded also from the neritic of the tropical Caribbean and subtropical Atlantic South Shelf Provinces: Asterigerina carinata, Dyocibicides biserialis, Elphidium discoidale, Nonionoides grateloupii, Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, Reussella atlantica and Sahulia conica. We are confident in our identifications of A. carinata and E. discoidale, but suggest that these names may have been applied to several cryptospecies. Some of these may have been transported on floating phytal debris, A. carinata, which supports algal symbionts, having been recorded at abyssal depths in the eastern North Atlantic. Othersmay have been transported as small propagules (proloculi). Although there may be a constant rain of such specimens into Liverpool Bay, we conclude on the basis of their rarity that the exotic species are unlikely to be able to overwinter there. We suggest, however, that these may have potential as invasive species for Liverpool Bay as climates continue to warm. This is not the earliest instance of transport of exotic species across the North Atlantic. The Late Eocene species Asterocyclina soldadoensis has been recorded from both the southern Caribbean region and offshore Ireland.

2022: Possibly the oldest fish-made resting traces
Abstract: Abstract The Silurian Sharawra Member (middle to late Llandoverian) in Saudi Arabia exhibits unique surface traces with exceptional preservation: Seven small, wing-shaped traces occur on a sandstone slab showing well-defined hummocky cross-stratification having a few decimeters wavelength being covered by a thin mud layer. These traces are preserved as concave epirelief along with elongated internal striae and surrounded by slightly elevated levees. Preservation of these delicate, 10–20 mm long and ∼10 mm wide traces suggests that they were formed after a storm event when mud had already settled to the sediment surface. The lack of wave-generated sedimentary structures implies deposition between fair-weather and storm-wave base probably preventing further rapid reworking by waves. Based on their geometry, internal pattern, and spatial distribution, these wing-shaped traces are interpreted to have been produced by relatively stationary bottom-feeding fish, morphologically similar to ancestors of Gobiidae, probably in the Actinopterygii class. The majority of fish-made trace fossils record feeding and locomotion behaviour, whereas the wing-shaped traces are interpreted to represent resting structures made by fish that pressed their fins downward on the muddy sediment surface and hence, represent undertracks. These traces are possibly the oldest fish-made structure documented thus far. These wing-shaped traces are described as Pisquiesichnus dashtgardi igen. et isp. nov. in this study.

2022: ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO “REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME DIAGNOSTIC AGGLUTINATED FORAMINIFERAL GENERA OF THE SUBCLASS MONOTHALAMANA (Bathysiphon, Orbulinelloides, Repmanina, Miliammina, Agglutinella, Dentostomenia, Ammomassilina, Psammolingulina) IN THE TETHYS” BY ANAN (2021)
Abstract: The species is Orbulinelloides kaminskii Anan, 2021 was described based on an illustration published by Kaminski & Huang in 1991. In this study we located and investigated the type specimen of O. kaminskii and confirmed that the outer wall displays randomly-placed openings that vary in size from 5–15 microns in diameter. The holotype specimen has been deposited in the collections of the European Micropaleontological Reference Centre, located at the AGH University of Science & Technology in Kraków, Poland.

2022: The test wall of ?Nubeculina Cushman 1924 (Miliolida): updates on its agglutinated-porcelaneous wall structure from entire and sectioned specimens
Abstract: There is a growing number of new foraminifera with agglutinated wall types held together by secreted crystallites of high-magnesium calcite that do not fit within the traditional definition of the Miliolida. In this study, we analyzed entire and sectioned foraminiferal specimens frommodern marine sediments collected off the Croatian coast (Adriatic Sea) using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) equipped with Energy-Dispersive x-ray-Spectroscopy (EDS). The investigated specimens resemble the miliolid genera Nubeculina Cushman 1924 and Falsonubeculina Amao and Kaminski 2019, but display characteristics of testmorphology and an agglutinated-porcelaneous wall structure that have not been previously observed in similar miliolids. Their wall structure is more like that observed in primitive agglutinated foraminifera such as Lagenammina rather than in true miliolids. New taxonomical inferences regarding the nubeculinid group of genera are discussed.

2022: LOWER PALEOCENE DEEP-WATER AGGLUTINATED FORAMINIFERA FROM THE CONTESSA HIGHWAY SECTION (UMBRIA-MARCHE BASIN, ITALY): TAXONOMY, STRATIGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSEMBLAGE TURNOVER ACROSS THE CRETACEOUS/PALEOGENE BOUNDARY
Abstract: Deep-water agglutinated foraminifera (DWAF) are investigated from the lower Paleocene of the Contessa Highway Paleocene (CHP) section in the Umbria-Marche Basin in Italy. In the lowermost part of the Paleocene corresponding to the P0–Pα interval and lowermost P1 planktonic foraminifera zones, a total of 46 species of DWAF are identified. A comparison with the uppermost Maastrichtian DWAF assemblages documented by Cetean (2009) results in a combined total of 94 DWAF species over the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval at Contessa Highway. Of these, 49 species are listed as extinction taxa, nine are survivor taxa, 19 are Lazarus taxa, and 17 taxa display first occurrences in the Paleocene. The record of DWAF in the Contessa Highway Paleocene section displays a moderate decrease in diversity across the K/Pg boundary, followed by a gradual recovery in the first meter of the Paleocene. The lower Paleocene record is characterized by blooms of opportunistic species belonging to the genera Reophax, Subreophax, Repmanina, and Spiroplectinella. The K/Pg boundary interval records a major change in the proportions of DWAF morphogroups, from a suspension-feeding community in the Maastrichtian to one dominated by epifaunal detritivores in the lower Paleocene, reflecting a fundamental change in marine primary productivity following the bolide impact.

2022: The "Bradleya problem", the spearhead of ostracod-based paleoceanography - contribution and outcomes
Abstract: Since their origin in the Ordovician, ostracods have radiated to several different aquatic and even semiterrestrial environments, evolving under influence of both extrinsic (ecological) and intrinsic (genetic) factors. The deep ocean does not constitute an exception to these controls, no matter how different the concept of deep-sea might be among students of Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic ostracods. Once integrated to the bathybic biotas (i.e., from bathyal to abyssal depths, including guyots), ostracods followed a particular pattern of diversification and dispersal in response to climatic and tectonic events.

2021: A Neotype for Neogloboquadrina atlantica (Berggren 1972)
Abstract: Neogloboquadrina atlantica (Berggren 1972) is one of the most common planktonic foraminiferal species in the Upper Miocene and Pliocene at DSDP/IODP sites in the northern Atlantic. It was originally described from the upper Pliocene at DSDP Site 116 in the Rockall Trough, northeastern Atlantic. In the original description of the species, the depository of the illustrated type specimens was not specified. One of us (WAB) was under the impression that the illustrated type specimens of Neogloboquadrina atlantica had been sent to the Cushman Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. Unfortunately there is no record of the specimen slides having ever arrived at the museum (B. Huber, personal communication, 2020). Fortunately, the second author is still in possession of the shipboard sample residues from DSDP Leg 12, and was able to select a neotype specimen to replace the missing illustrated holotype. The purpose of this note is to designate a neotype specimen for Neogloboquadrina atlantica and to specify a repository for the permanent archive of the neotype and paraneotypes.

2021: Carbonate Pore Systems Variability in Shallow Marine Uppermost Jubaila Fm: Arab-D Reservoir Analogue in Saudi Arabia.
Abstract: Summary In research areas there are 3 depositional facies: Stromatoporoid wackestone-packstone (SWP), Dolomitic wackestone (DW), and Dolomitic mudstone (DM). Three types of diagenesis occurred which consist of: dolomitization, dissolution, and burial. Five of pore systems was recognized: Intercrystal non-fabric preserved (BC-nfp), Intercrystal fabric preserved (BC-fp), Intraparticle (WP), Fracture (FR), and Tight. Diagenesis play an important role in altering the depositional texture, pore systems control reservoir quality instead of lithology. Similar lithology will have different pore systems resulted in different reservoir quality. Therefore, diagenesis defines reservoir quality (RQ): Intercrystal non-fabric preserved (BC-nfp): Mostly in dolomitic mudstone (DM) – Dissolution created pore system which increase porosity and permeability (RRT-1). Intercrystal fabric preserved (BC-fp), interparticle: Experienced dissolution in different degree in SWP and DW – pore systems slightly increase porosity and permeability even though not significantly (RRT-2). Tight/minimum dissolution, fracture: Does not created of pore space but it tighten the rocks and reduce porosity and permeability (RRT-3).

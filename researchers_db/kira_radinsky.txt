2025: ReactEmbed: A Cross-Domain Framework for Protein-Molecule Representation Learning via Biochemical Reaction Networks
Abstract: The challenge in computational biology and drug discovery lies in creating comprehensive representations of proteins and molecules that capture their intrinsic properties and interactions. Traditional methods often focus on unimodal data, such as protein sequences or molecular structures, limiting their ability to capture complex biochemical relationships. This work enhances these representations by integrating biochemical reactions encompassing interactions between molecules and proteins. By leveraging reaction data alongside pre-trained embeddings from state-of-the-art protein and molecule models, we develop ReactEmbed, a novel method that creates a unified embedding space through contrastive learning. We evaluate ReactEmbed across diverse tasks, including drug-target interaction, protein-protein interaction, protein property prediction, and molecular property prediction, consistently surpassing all current state-of-the-art models. Notably, we showcase ReactEmbed's practical utility through successful implementation in lipid nanoparticle-based drug delivery, enabling zero-shot prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability for protein-nanoparticle complexes. The code and comprehensive database of reaction pairs are available for open use at \href{https://github.com/amitaysicherman/ReactEmbed}{GitHub}.

2025: Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration
Abstract: Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.

2024: Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using Neural Fourier Transform
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is a pivotal task in several domains, including financial planning, medical diagnostics, and climate science. This paper presents the Neural Fourier Transform (NFT) algorithm, which combines multi-dimensional Fourier transforms with Temporal Convolutional Network layers to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. The Neural Fourier Transform is empirically validated on fourteen diverse datasets, showing superior performance across multiple forecasting horizons and lookbacks, setting new benchmarks in the field. This work advances multivariate time series forecasting by providing a model that is both interpretable and highly predictive, making it a valuable tool for both practitioners and researchers. The code for this study is publicly available.

2024: GOProteinGNN: Leveraging Protein Knowledge Graphs for Protein Representation Learning
Abstract: Proteins play a vital role in biological processes and are indispensable for living organisms. Accurate representation of proteins is crucial, especially in drug development. Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques for unsupervised learning of protein representations. However, these approaches often focus solely on the amino acid sequence of proteins and lack factual knowledge about proteins and their interactions, thus limiting their performance. In this study, we present GOProteinGNN, a novel architecture that enhances protein language models by integrating protein knowledge graph information during the creation of amino acid level representations. Our approach allows for the integration of information at both the individual amino acid level and the entire protein level, enabling a comprehensive and effective learning process through graph-based learning. By doing so, we can capture complex relationships and dependencies between proteins and their functional annotations, resulting in more robust and contextually enriched protein representations. Unlike previous methods, GOProteinGNN uniquely learns the entire protein knowledge graph during training, which allows it to capture broader relational nuances and dependencies beyond mere triplets as done in previous work. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on several downstream tasks demonstrating that GOProteinGNN consistently outperforms previous methods, showcasing its effectiveness and establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for protein representation learning.

2024: Molecular Optimization Model with Patentability Constraint
Abstract: In drug development, molecular optimization is a crucial challenge that involves generating novel molecules given a lead molecule as input. The task requires maintaining molecular similarity to the original molecule while simultaneously optimizing multiple chemical attributes. To aid in this process, numerous generative models have been proposed.
However, in practical applications, it is crucial for these models not only to generate novel molecules with the above constraints but also to generate molecules that significantly differ from any existing patented compounds. 
In this work, we present a multi-optimization molecular framework to address this challenge.
Our framework trains a model to prioritize both enhanced properties and substantial dissimilarity from patented compounds. By jointly learning continuous representations of optimized and patentable molecules, we ensure that the generated molecules are significantly distant from any patented compounds while improving chemical properties.
Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art molecular optimization methods both in chemical property optimization and patentability.

2024: Leveraging Prototypical Representations for Mitigating Social Bias without Demographic Information
Abstract: Mitigating social biases typically requires identifying the social groups associated with each data sample. In this paper, we present DAFair, a novel approach to address social bias in language models. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit demographic labels, our approach does not require any such information. Instead, we leverage predefined prototypical demographic texts and incorporate a regularization term during the fine-tuning process to mitigate bias in the model’s representations. Our empirical results across two tasks and two models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches that do not rely on labeled data. Moreover, with limited demographic-annotated data, our approach outperforms common debiasing approaches.

2024: Ordinary Differential Equations for Enhanced 12-Lead ECG Generation
Abstract: In the realm of artificial intelligence, the generation of realistic training data for supervised learning tasks presents a significant challenge. This is particularly true in the synthesis of electrocardiograms (ECGs), where the objective is to develop a synthetic 12-lead ECG model. The primary complexity of this task stems from accurately modeling the intricate biological and physiological interactions among different ECG leads. Although mathematical process simulators have shed light on these dynamics, effectively incorporating this understanding into generative models is not straightforward. In this work, we introduce an innovative method that employs ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enhance the fidelity of generating 12-lead ECG data. This approach integrates a system of ODEs that represent cardiac dynamics directly into the generative model's optimization process, allowing for the production of biologically plausible ECG training data that authentically reflects real-world variability and inter-lead dependencies. We conducted an empirical analysis of thousands of ECGs and found that incorporating cardiac simulation insights into the data generation process significantly improves the accuracy of heart abnormality classifiers trained on this synthetic 12-lead ECG data.

2024: Leveraging Temporal Trends for Training Contextual Word Embeddings to Address Bias in Biomedical Applications: Development Study
Abstract: Background Women have been underrepresented in clinical trials for many years. Machine-learning models trained on clinical trial abstracts may capture and amplify biases in the data. Specifically, word embeddings are models that enable representing words as vectors and are the building block of most natural language processing systems. If word embeddings are trained on clinical trial abstracts, predictive models that use the embeddings will exhibit gender performance gaps. Objective We aim to capture temporal trends in clinical trials through temporal distribution matching on contextual word embeddings (specifically, BERT) and explore its effect on the bias manifested in downstream tasks. Methods We present TeDi-BERT, a method to harness the temporal trend of increasing women’s inclusion in clinical trials to train contextual word embeddings. We implement temporal distribution matching through an adversarial classifier, trying to distinguish old from new clinical trial abstracts based on their embeddings. The temporal distribution matching acts as a form of domain adaptation from older to more recent clinical trials. We evaluate our model on 2 clinical tasks: prediction of unplanned readmission to the intensive care unit and hospital length of stay prediction. We also conduct an algorithmic analysis of the proposed method. Results In readmission prediction, TeDi-BERT achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.64 for female patients versus the baseline of 0.62 (P<.001), and 0.66 for male patients versus the baseline of 0.64 (P<.001). In the length of stay regression, TeDi-BERT achieved a mean absolute error of 4.56 (95% CI 4.44-4.68) for female patients versus 4.62 (95% CI 4.50-4.74, P<.001) and 4.54 (95% CI 4.44-4.65) for male patients versus 4.6 (95% CI 4.50-4.71, P<.001). Conclusions In both clinical tasks, TeDi-BERT improved performance for female patients, as expected; but it also improved performance for male patients. Our results show that accuracy for one gender does not need to be exchanged for bias reduction, but rather that good science improves clinical results for all. Contextual word embedding models trained to capture temporal trends can help mitigate the effects of bias that changes over time in the training data.

2023: GraphERT-- Transformers-based Temporal Dynamic Graph Embedding
Abstract: Dynamic temporal graphs evolve over time, adding and removing nodes and edges between time snapshots. The tasks performed on such graphs are diverse and include detecting temporal trends, finding graph-to-graph similarities, and graph visualization and clustering. For all these tasks, it is necessary to embed the entire graph in a low-dimensional space by using graph-level representations instead of the more common node-level representations. This embedding requires handling the appearance of new nodes over time as well as capturing temporal patterns of the entire graph. Most existing methods perform temporal node embeddings and focus on different methods of aggregating them for a graph-based representation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end architecture that captures both the node embeddings and their influence in a structural context during a specific time period of the graph. We present GraphERT (Graph Embedding Representation using Transformers), a novel approach to temporal graph-level embeddings. Our method pioneers the use of Transformers to seamlessly integrate graph structure learning with temporal analysis. By employing a masked language model on sequences of graph random walks, together with a novel temporal classification task, our model not only comprehends the intricate graph dynamics but also unravels the temporal significance of each node and path. This novel training paradigm empowers GraphERT to capture the essence of both the structural and temporal aspects of graphs, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple tasks on real-world datasets.

2023: Shielded Representations: Protecting Sensitive Attributes Through Iterative Gradient-Based Projection
Abstract: Natural language processing models tend to learn and encode social biases present in the data. One popular approach for addressing such biases is to eliminate encoded information from the model's representations. However, current methods are restricted to removing only linearly encoded information. In this work, we propose Iterative Gradient-Based Projection (IGBP), a novel method for removing non-linear encoded concepts from neural representations. Our method consists of iteratively training neural classifiers to predict a particular attribute we seek to eliminate, followed by a projection of the representation on a hypersurface, such that the classifiers become oblivious to the target attribute. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the task of removing gender and race information as sensitive attributes. Our results demonstrate that IGBP is effective in mitigating bias through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, with minimal impact on downstream task accuracy.

2023: CFOM: Lead Optimization For Drug Discovery With Limited Data
Abstract: Drug development is a long and costly process consisting of several stages that can take many years to complete. One of the early stage's goals is to optimize a novel chemical compound to be active against a target protein associated with the disease. Often machine learning techniques are used to improve the procedure of discovering and optimizing potential drug candidates. The goal of molecule optimization is, given an input molecule, to produce a new molecule that is chemically similar to the input molecule but with an improved property. We present a novel algorithm that during optimization divides a molecule into two disjoint substructures that we call: the molecule chains and the molecule core. Our approach is inspired by expert design of chemical compounds that employ a fundamental molecular template and add to it chemical functional groups to generate compounds with desired properties. We train a model to generate the molecule chains with the desired properties for optimization, which are then attached to the molecule core to construct a novel molecule with high similarity to the input molecule. This is achieved by selective masking of pairs of input molecules' chains and cores during training. Additionally, we demonstrate the extension of this approach to data-scarce tasks, like targeting a drug to a novel protein. We first evaluate our method on standard molecule optimization tasks such as inhibition against glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β). We then empirically compared the model performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms over 21 novel proteins and show superior performance.

2023: Self-supervised Classification of Clinical Multivariate Time Series using Time Series Dynamics
Abstract: To improve the accuracy of clinical multivariate time series (MTS) classification (such as EEG and ECG) by a novel self-supervised paradigm that directly captures the dynamics between the different time series learned together to optimize the classification task. Labels in clinical datasets are very often insufficient. One way to address this challenge is leveraging self-supervision. This paradigm attempts to identify a supervisory signal inherent within a dataset to serve as a surrogate label. We present a novel form of self-supervision: dynamics of clinical MTS. Unlike other self-supervision methods, such as masking, that are intuitive but still heuristic, we suggest to learn a representation justified by Koopman theory. The latter was shown useful for representing clinical time series and can be used as a form of surrogate task to improve the clinical MTS classification. In the ECG task, we show that our proposed framework achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline over numerous common diagnoses. For EEG abnormality classification, our proposed framework also achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the SOTA baseline. All results are statistically significant. Our technique yields reliable clinical diagnosis in an empirical study employing signals from thousands of patients in multiple clinical tasks employing two types of clinical-grade sensors (ECG and EEG) as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning. Leveraging time-series-dynamics self-supervision can help mitigate the lack of labels in clinical datasets used for training machine learning algorithms and significantly improve their performance. Specifically, the ECG system presented in this work is being trialed in hospitals, used by top cardiologists for patient diagnosis and treatment. We believe that the deployment of such cutting-edge technology will significantly improve the accuracy and speed of cardiac assessments.

2023: Generating Optimized Molecules without Patent Infringement
Abstract: Molecular optimization seeks to improve a given molecule's therapeutic profile. It is a key challenge in drug development, but it is difficult due to the constraints of molecular similarity to the original molecule and the size of the chemical space to explore. Numerous works tackled this problem with initial success. Unlike previous works that focus on generating molecules that optimize chemical properties, we focus on the optimization while attempting to "move away" from patented molecules. We present a novel loss function and its utilization in numerous types of molecular optimization algorithms. The loss allows to improve molecular properties while decreasing patent-infringement. We perform empirical evaluation showing superior performance of state-of-the-art models when using the novel loss function. The deployment of the system is underway at the Targeted Drug Delivery and Personalized Medicine labs. It will be utilized to generate targeted carriers of mRNA, providing a new method of drug delivery. The system is also producing non-patented candidates for industrial use, making it a valuable tool in the field of personalized medicine.

2022: tBDFS: Temporal Graph Neural Network Leveraging DFS
Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) have been widely researched, reaching state-of-the-art results on multiple prediction tasks. A common approach employed by most previous works is to apply a layer that aggregates information from the historical neighbors of a node. Taking a dif- ferent research direction, in this work, we propose tBDFS – a novel temporal GNN architecture. tBDFS applies a layer that efﬁciently aggregates information from temporal paths to a given (target) node in the graph. For each given node, the aggregation is applied in two stages: (1) A single representation is learned for each temporal path ending in that node, and (2) all path representations are aggregated into a ﬁnal node representation. Overall, our goal is not to add new information to a node, but rather observe the same exact information in a new perspective. This allows our model to directly observe patterns that are path-oriented rather than neighborhood-oriented. This can be thought as a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal over the temporal graph, compared to the popular Breath-First Search (BFS) traversal that is applied in previous works. We evaluate tBDFS over multiple link prediction tasks and show its favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to apply a temporal-DFS neural network.

2022: Temporal Attention for Language Models
Abstract: Pretrained language models based on the transformer architecture have shown great success in NLP. Textual training data often comes from the web and is thus tagged with time-specific information, but most language models ignore this information. They are trained on the textual data alone, limiting their ability to generalize temporally. In this work, we extend the key component of the transformer architecture, i.e., the self-attention mechanism, and propose temporal attention - a time-aware self-attention mechanism. Temporal attention can be applied to any transformer model and requires the input texts to be accompanied with their relevant time points. It allows the transformer to capture this temporal information and create time-specific contextualized word representations. We leverage these representations for the task of semantic change detection; we apply our proposed mechanism to BERT and experiment on three datasets in different languages (English, German, and Latin) that also vary in time, size, and genre. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on all the datasets.

2022: Leveraging World Events to Predict E-Commerce Consumer Demand under Anomaly
Abstract: Consumer demand forecasting is of high importance for many e-commerce applications, including supply chain optimization, advertisement placement, and delivery speed optimization. However, reliable time series sales forecasting for e-commerce is difficult, especially during periods with many anomalies, as can often happen during pandemics, abnormal weather, or sports events. Although many time series algorithms have been applied to the task, prediction during anomalies still remains a challenge. In this work, we hypothesize that leveraging external knowledge found in world events can help overcome the challenge of prediction under anomalies. We mine a large repository of 40 years of world events and their textual representations. Further, we present a novel methodology based on transformers to construct an embedding of a day based on the relations of the day's events. Those embeddings are then used to forecast future consumer behavior. We empirically evaluate the methods over a large e-commerce products sales dataset, extracted from eBay, one of the world's largest online marketplaces. We show over numerous categories that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines during anomalies.

2022: What If: Generating Code to Answer Simulation Questions in Chemistry Texts
Abstract: Many texts, especially in chemistry and biology, describe complex processes. We focus on texts that describe a chemical reaction process and questions that ask about the process's outcome under different environmental conditions. To answer questions about such processes, one needs to understand the interactions between the different entities involved in the process and simulate their state transitions during the process execution under other conditions. We hypothesize that generating code and executing it to simulate the process will allow answering such questions. We, therefore, define a domain-specific language (DSL) to represent processes. We contribute to the community a unique dataset curated by chemists and annotated by computer scientists. The dataset is composed of process texts, simulation questions, and their corresponding computer codes represented by the DSL. We propose a neural program synthesis approach based on reinforcement learning with a novel state-transition semantic reward. The novel reward is based on the run-time semantic similarity between the predicted code and the reference code. This allows simulating complex process transitions and thus answering simulation questions. Our approach yields a significant boost in accuracy for simulation questions: we achieved 88% accuracy as opposed to 83% accuracy of the state-of-the-art neural program synthesis approaches and 54% accuracy of state-of-the-art end-to-end text-based approaches.

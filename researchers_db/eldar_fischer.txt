2023: MC-finiteness of restricted set partition functions
Abstract: A sequence $s(n)$ of integers is MC-finite if for every $m \in \mathbb{N}^+$ the sequence $s^m(n) = s(n) \bmod{m}$ is ultimately periodic. We discuss various ways of proving and disproving MC-finiteness. Our examples are mostly taken from set partition functions, but our methods can be applied to many more integer sequences.

2023: Support Testing in the Huge Object Model
Abstract: The Huge Object model is a distribution testing model in which we are given access to independent samples from an unknown distribution over the set of strings $\{0,1\}^n$, but are only allowed to query a few bits from the samples. We investigate the problem of testing whether a distribution is supported on $m$ elements in this model. It turns out that the behavior of this property is surprisingly intricate, especially when also considering the question of adaptivity. We prove lower and upper bounds for both adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms in the one-sided and two-sided error regime. Our bounds are tight when $m$ is fixed to a constant (and the distance parameter $\varepsilon$ is the only variable). For the general case, our bounds are at most $O(\log m)$ apart. In particular, our results show a surprising $O(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ gap between the number of queries required for non-adaptive testing as compared to adaptive testing. For one sided error testing, we also show that a $O(\log m)$ gap between the number of samples and the number of queries is necessary. Our results utilize a wide variety of combinatorial and probabilistic methods.

2023: Refining the Adaptivity Notion in the Huge Object Model
Abstract: The Huge Object model for distribution testing, first defined by Goldreich and Ron in 2022, combines the features of classical string testing and distribution testing. In this model we are given access to independent samples from an unknown distribution $P$ over the set of strings $\{0,1\}^n$, but are only allowed to query a few bits from the samples. The distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, which occurs naturally in the realm of string testing (while being irrelevant for classical distribution testing), plays a substantial role also in the Huge Object model. In this work we show that the full picture in the Huge Object model is much richer than just that of the ``adaptive vs. non-adaptive'' dichotomy. We define and investigate several models of adaptivity that lie between the fully-adaptive and the completely non-adaptive extremes. These models are naturally grounded by observing the querying process from each sample independently, and considering the ``algorithmic flow'' between them. For example, if we allow no information at all to cross over between samples (up to the final decision), then we obtain the locally bounded adaptive model, arguably the ``least adaptive'' one apart from being completely non-adaptive. A slightly stronger model allows only a ``one-way'' information flow. Even stronger (but still far from being fully adaptive) models follow by taking inspiration from the setting of streaming algorithms. To show that we indeed have a hierarchy, we prove a chain of exponential separations encompassing most of the models that we define.

2022: Testing of Index-Invariant Properties in the Huge Object Model
Abstract: The study of distribution testing has become ubiquitous in the area of property testing, both for its theoretical appeal, as well as for its applications in other fields of Computer Science. The original distribution testing model relies on samples drawn independently from the distribution to be tested. However, when testing distributions over the $n$-dimensional Hamming cube $\left\{0,1\right\}^{n}$ for a large $n$, even reading a few samples is infeasible. To address this, Goldreich and Ron [ITCS 2022] have defined a model called the huge object model, in which the samples may only be queried in a few places. In this work, we initiate a study of a general class of properties in the huge object model, those that are invariant under a permutation of the indices of the vectors in $\left\{0,1\right\}^{n}$, while still not being necessarily fully symmetric as per the definition used in traditional distribution testing. We prove that every index-invariant property satisfying a bounded VC-dimension restriction admits a property tester with a number of queries independent of n. To complement this result, we argue that satisfying only index-invariance or only a VC-dimension bound is insufficient to guarantee a tester whose query complexity is independent of n. Moreover, we prove that the dependency of sample and query complexities of our tester on the VC-dimension is tight. As a second part of this work, we address the question of the number of queries required for non-adaptive testing. We show that it can be at most quadratic in the number of queries required for an adaptive tester of index-invariant properties. This is in contrast with the tight exponential gap for general non-index-invariant properties. Finally, we provide an index-invariant property for which the quadratic gap between adaptive and non-adaptive query complexities for testing is almost tight.

2022: Extensions and Limits of the Specker-Blatter Theorem
Abstract: The original Specker-Blatter Theorem (1983) was formulated for classes of structures $\mathcal{C}$ of one or several binary relations definable in Monadic Second Order Logic MSOL. It states that the number of such structures on the set $[n]$ is modularly C-finite (MC-finite). In previous work we extended this to structures definable in CMSOL, MSOL extended with modular counting quantifiers. The first author also showed that the Specker-Blatter Theorem does not hold for one quaternary relation (2003). If the vocabulary allows a constant symbol $c$, there are $n$ possible interpretations on $[n]$ for $c$. We say that a constant $c$ is {\em hard-wired} if $c$ is always interpreted by the same element $j \in [n]$. In this paper we show: 1. The Specker-Blatter Theorem also holds for CMSOL when hard-wired constants are allowed. The proof method of Specker and Blatter does not work in this case. 2. The Specker-Blatter Theorem does not hold already for $\mathcal{C}$ with one ternary relation definable in First Order Logic FOL. This was left open since 1983. Using hard-wired constants allows us to show MC-finiteness of counting functions of various restricted partition functions which were not known to be MC-finite till now. Among them we have the restricted Bell numbers $B_{r,A}$, restricted Stirling numbers of the second kind $S_{r,A}$ or restricted Lah-numbers $L_{r,A}$. Here $r$ is an non-negative integer and $A$ is an ultimately periodic set of non-negative integers.

2021: Exploring the Gap Between Tolerant and Non-Tolerant Distribution Testing
Abstract: The framework of distribution testing is currently ubiquitous in the field of property testing. In this model, the input is a probability distribution accessible via independently drawn samples from an oracle. The testing task is to distinguish a distribution that satisfies some property from a distribution that is far in some distance measure from satisfying it. The task of tolerant testing imposes a further restriction, that distributions close to satisfying the property are also accepted. This work focuses on the connection between the sample complexities of non-tolerant testing of distributions and their tolerant testing counterparts. When limiting our scope to label-invariant (symmetric) properties of distributions, we prove that the gap is at most quadratic, ignoring poly-logarithmic factors. Conversely, the property of being the uniform distribution is indeed known to have an almost-quadratic gap. When moving to general, not necessarily label-invariant properties, the situation is more complicated, and we show some partial results. We show that if a property requires the distributions to be non-concentrated, that is, the probability mass of the distribution is sufficiently spread out, then it cannot be non-tolerantly tested with $o(\sqrt {n})$ many samples, where n denotes the universe size. Clearly, this implies at most a quadratic gap, because a distribution can be learned (and hence tolerantly tested against any property) using $\mathcal {O}(n)$ many samples. Being non-concentrated is a strong requirement on properties, as we also prove a close to linear lower bound against their tolerant tests. Apart from the case where the distribution is non-concentrated, we also show if an input distribution is very concentrated, in the sense that it is mostly supported on a subset of size s of the universe, then it can be learned using only $\mathcal {O}(s)$ many samples. The learning procedure adapts to the input, and works without knowing s in advance.

2019: Hard properties with (very) short PCPPs and their applications
Abstract: We show that there exist properties that are maximally hard for testing, while still admitting PCPPs with a proof size very close to linear. Specifically, for every fixed $\ell$, we construct a property $\mathcal{P}^{(\ell)}\subseteq\{0,1\}^n$ satisfying the following: Any testing algorithm for $\mathcal{P}^{(\ell)}$ requires $\Omega(n)$ many queries, and yet $\mathcal{P}^{(\ell)}$ has a constant query PCPP whose proof size is $O(n\cdot \log^{(\ell)}n)$, where $\log^{(\ell)}$ denotes the $\ell$ times iterated log function (e.g., $\log^{(2)}n = \log \log n$). The best previously known upper bound on the PCPP proof size for a maximally hard to test property was $O(n \cdot \mathrm{poly}\log{n})$. 
As an immediate application, we obtain stronger separations between the standard testing model and both the tolerant testing model and the erasure-resilient testing model: for every fixed $\ell$, we construct a property that has a constant-query tester, but requires $\Omega(n/\log^{(\ell)}(n))$ queries for every tolerant or erasure-resilient tester.

2019: Longest paths in 2-edge-connected cubic graphs
Abstract: We prove almost tight bounds on the length of paths in $2$-edge-connected cubic graphs. Concretely, we show that (i) every $2$-edge-connected cubic graph of size $n$ has a path of length $\Omega\left(\frac{\log^2{n}}{\log{\log{n}}}\right)$, and (ii) there exists a $2$-edge-connected cubic graph, such that every path in the graph has length $O(\log^2{n})$.

Abstract: The emerging theory of graph limits exhibits an analytic perspective on graphs, showing that many important concepts and tools in graph theory and its applications can be described more naturally (and sometimes proved more easily) in analytic language. We extend the theory of graph limits to the ordered setting, presenting a limit object for dense vertex-ordered graphs, which we call an orderon. As a special case, this yields limit objects for matrices whose rows and columns are ordered, and for dynamic graphs that expand (via vertex insertions) over time. Along the way, we devise an ordered locality-preserving variant of the cut distance between ordered graphs, showing that two graphs are close with respect to this distance if and only if they are similar in terms of their ordered subgraph frequencies. We show that the space of orderons is compact with respect to this distance notion, which is key to a successful analysis of combinatorial objects through their limits. For the proof we combine techniques used in the unordered setting with several new techniques specifically designed to overcome the challenges arising in the ordered setting. We derive several applications of the ordered limit theory in extremal combinatorics, sampling, and property testing in ordered graphs. In particular, we prove a new ordered analogue of the well-known result by Alon and Stav [RS&A’08] on the furthest graph from a hereditary property; this is the first known result of this type in the ordered setting. Unlike the unordered regime, here the ErdősRényi random graph G(n, p) with an ordering over the vertices is not always asymptotically the furthest from the property for some p. However, using our ordered limit theory, we show that random graphs generated by a stochastic block model, where the blocks are consecutive in the vertex ordering, are (approximately) the furthest. Additionally, we describe an alternative analytic proof of the ordered graph removal lemma [Alon et al., FOCS’17]. Tel Aviv University, Israel. Email: omrib@mail.tau.ac.il.

Specifically, for every fixed l, we construct a property P ⊆ {0, 1} satisfying the following: Any testing algorithm for P requires Ω(n) many queries, and yet P has a constant query PCPP whose proof size is O(n · log n), where log denotes the l times iterated log function (e.g., log n = log logn). The best previously known upper bound on the PCPP proof size for a maximally hard to test property was O(n · polylog n). As an immediate application, we obtain stronger separations between the standard testing model and both the tolerant testing model and the erasure-resilient testing model: for every fixed l, we construct a property that has a constant-query tester, but requires Ω(n/ log(n)) queries for every tolerant or erasure-resilient tester.

2018: Limits of Ordered Graphs and Images
Abstract: The emerging theory of graph limits exhibits an interesting analytic perspective on graphs, showing that many important concepts and tools in graph theory and its applications can be described naturally in analytic language. We extend the theory of graph limits to the ordered setting, presenting a limit object for dense vertex-ordered graphs, which we call an orderon. Images are an example of dense ordered bipartite graphs, where the rows and the columns constitute the vertices, and pixel colors are represented by row-column edges; thus, as a special case, we obtain a limit object for images. 
Along the way, we devise an ordered locality-preserving variant of the cut distance between ordered graphs, showing that two graphs are close with respect to this distance if and only if they are similar in terms of their ordered subgraph frequencies. We show that the space of orderons is compact with respect to this distance notion, which is key to a successful analysis of combinatorial objects through their limits. For the proof we combine techniques used in the unordered setting with several new techniques specifically designed to overcome the challenges arising in the ordered setting. We derive several results related to sampling and property testing on ordered graphs and images; For example, we describe how one can use the analytic machinery to obtain a new proof of the ordered graph removal lemma [Alon et al., FOCS 2017].

2018: Earthmover Resilience and Testing in Ordered Structures
Abstract: One of the main challenges in property testing is to characterize those properties that are testable with a constant number of queries. For unordered structures such as graphs and hypergraphs this task has been mostly settled. However, for ordered structures such as strings, images, and ordered graphs, the characterization problem seems very difficult in general. 
In this paper, we identify a wide class of properties of ordered structures - the earthmover resilient (ER) properties - and show that the "good behavior" of such properties allows us to obtain general testability results that are similar to (and more general than) those of unordered graphs. A property P is ER if, roughly speaking, slight changes in the order of the elements in an object satisfying P cannot make this object far from P. The class of ER properties includes, e.g., all unordered graph properties, many natural visual properties of images, such as convexity, and all hereditary properties of ordered graphs and images. 
A special case of our results implies, building on a recent result of Alon and the authors, that the distance of a given image or ordered graph from any hereditary property can be estimated (with good probability) up to a constant additive error, using a constant number of queries.

2017: Testing Hereditary Properties of Ordered Graphs and Matrices
Abstract: We consider properties of edge-colored vertex-ordered graphs} &#x2013; graphs with a totally ordered vertex set and a finite set of possible edge colors &#x2013; showing that any hereditary property of such graphs is strongly testable, i.e., testable with a constant number of queries. We also explain how the proof can be adapted to show that any hereditary property of two-dimensional matrices over a finite alphabet (where row and column order is not ignored) is strongly testable. The first result generalizes the result of Alon and Shapira [FOCS05; SICOMP08], who showed that any hereditary graph property (without vertex order) is strongly testable. The second result answers and generalizes a conjecture of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP07] concerning testing of matrix properties.The testability is proved by establishing a removal lemma for vertex-ordered graphs. It states that if such a graph is far enough from satisfying a certain hereditary property, then most of its induced vertex-ordered subgraphs on a certain (large enough) constant number of vertices do not satisfy the property as well.The proof bridges the gap between techniques related to the regularity lemma, used in the long chain of papers investigating graph testing, and string testing techniques. Along the way we develop a Ramsey-type lemma for multipartite graphs with undesirable edges, stating that one can find a Ramsey-type structure in such a graph, in which the density of the undesirable edges is not much higher than the density of those edges in the graph.

2017: Improved bounds for testing Dyck languages
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of deciding membership in Dyck languages, a fundamental family of context-free languages, comprised of well-balanced strings of parentheses. In this problem we are given a string of length $n$ in the alphabet of parentheses of $m$ types and must decide if it is well-balanced. We consider this problem in the property testing setting, where one would like to make the decision while querying as few characters of the input as possible. 
Property testing of strings for Dyck language membership for $m=1$, with a number of queries independent of the input size $n$, was provided in [Alon, Krivelevich, Newman and Szegedy, SICOMP 2001]. Property testing of strings for Dyck language membership for $m \ge 2$ was first investigated in [Parnas, Ron and Rubinfeld, RSA 2003]. They showed an upper bound and a lower bound for distinguishing strings belonging to the language from strings that are far (in terms of the Hamming distance) from the language, which are respectively (up to polylogarithmic factors) the $2/3$ power and the $1/11$ power of the input size $n$. 
Here we improve the power of $n$ in both bounds. For the upper bound, we introduce a recursion technique, that together with a refinement of the methods in the original work provides a test for any power of $n$ larger than $2/5$. For the lower bound, we introduce a new problem called Truestring Equivalence, which is easily reducible to the $2$-type Dyck language property testing problem. For this new problem, we show a lower bound of $n$ to the power of $1/5$.

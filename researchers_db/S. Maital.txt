2017: Smartonomics: Simple, Powerful Macroeconomic Tools for Success in an Uncertain World
Abstract: In today’s global village, every manager is a global manager. Even if your business is putatively 'local', with no sales abroad, you still probably face competitors in other countries. 
 
Smartonomics provides global managers with a simple, powerful set of macroeconomic tools, many of which have been until now rather opaque for non-economists, that empower them to think independently, swim against the tide (when warranted), and at times enter markets when everyone else is abandoning them. It will provide managers a holistic picture of the global marketplace and the systemic risks it conceals. 
 
Throughout this book, readers will find numerous case studies, illustrating how smart managers transform risk into opportunity, as well as numerous action learning exercises, to help readers test whether they understand the eight tools well enough to employ them and through them achieve important insights.

2016: Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the São Paulo Metropolis: The Role of Its Major University
Abstract: Sao Paulo is considered the most important financial center in Latin America and hosts one of the most respectful universities in Brazil: the University of Sao Paulo (USP). In spite of having the potential to be a leader in technological innovation and startup output, this ecosystem has not produced satisfactory results in the last decades. This article analyses the innovation environment around Sao Paulo's largest research university, using the factor analysis technique. Based on a workshop conducted with ecosystem experts, we identified the key anchors and processes present in the region. The analysis results led to recommendations of practical actions for both public and private sectors to engage in the ecosystem evolution.

2016: INNOVATE YOUR INNOVATION PROCESS: 100 PROVEN TOOLS
Abstract: Through a series of short stories and brief case studies about great innovators, this book will help managers and entrepreneurs rethink their innovation processes, using the tools outlined in the book. The eight chapters include narratives on: From Ideas to Action; Breaking the Rules; Learning Creativity from our Kids; Innovation as a Team Sport; and Innovating for Those with Less. The basic idea is that the best way to become a world-class innovator is to learn from other world-class innovators and to study what they did and how they did it.

2016: Beyond Pensions: A Radical Systems-Based Transformation of Present-Future Choice
Abstract: Aging populations worldwide, fiscal deficits, growing sovereign debt, and slowing economies have combined to create and exacerbate what is widely known as the “pension crisis”, characterized by poverty among the elderly substantially due to inadequate retirement income. We argue that the roots of the crisis go much deeper than “pensions”, and involve a long-term secular shift from saving and capital formation to consumption, in the West. Cosmetic “solutions” to the pension crisis, such as delaying the retirement age, are ineffective. The “pension crisis” label itself impedes clear thinking about developing an effective and affordable solution. The core of the problem is the fact that present-future choice tilted to “present”, in the West, for decades. Higher saving, over a longer time horizon, invested at higher average returns, is the ultimate goal, and only one that offers true long-term transformative change. We propose an original, radical, systemic solution, based on an evolutionary social transformation1 of present-future choice toward increased saving; a proposal that addresses the roots of the pension crisis, not just the symptoms.2 We contend that an effective pension allocation and accumulation system is a stable force for economic growth over time — but only when these significant capital investments are made directly in the real economy and take account of appropriate technological innovation. At the moment the bulk of global investment capital in the West is directed to short-term speculative activity in various financial markets, opportunistically taking advantage of historically low borrowing rates. We provide a macroeconomic simulation of our proposal, should it be adopted, comparing no-change and radical-change scenarios for the Israel economy, and urge scholars to carry out similar projections and analyses for individual OECD countries. We next show how an increase in national saving and capital formation can contribute to “rebalancing” the global economy, between low-saving Western nations and high-saving Asian ones. Finally, we outline our “four pillar” radical proposal, which leverages persistent long-run saving and investment, and illustrate its impact with some macroeconomic projections for Israel, comparing two scenarios, one with low national saving, the second with increased national saving. An achievable increase in the national saving rate, implemented through the tax system and accompanied by intelligent capital formation, can have enormous impact, it is shown, not only on elderly poverty but on society as a whole. In our plan, lower consumption demand through higher savings, is offset by higher capital formation, which has a larger employment and GDP multiplier.

2015: Demand-Driven Innovation: An Integrative Systems-Based Review of the Literature
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on demand-driven innovation, using a generic national innovation ecosystem map as a unifying framework. We organize the literature review around four key innovation dimensions and seven related demand-driven processes. Our review reveals that business networking which accelerates access to new markets and technologies is vital for free markets. But classical competition alone cannot sustain the creation of new technologies or innovation paths. Rather, national policy is essential in creating lead markets. On the other hand the private sector has a crucial task in leading R&D activity. We found that the relationship between R&D stock and productivity is mostly positive. With regard to cluster strategies our literature review suggests that increased variety of innovative activities strengthens regional economic growth through "spillover effects" between products and industries. Based on the literature, we found that universities are evolving to play a major role in the research of innovation. The enormous innovative potential of universities therefore should be directed toward shaping more effective tools for public–private cooperation. But innovation, whether its origin is in academe or elsewhere, must follow a standardization process in order to converge into a well-defined technology. Our paper highlights a fundamental paradox underlying pro-innovation policies: while innovators often express the desire for a liberal, open and flexible market system with minimal bureaucracy and governmental interference, to allow market-driven innovation to flourish, they often benefit greatly from a variety of governmental interventions that include direct or indirect financial support (such as tax credits).

2015: How People Interact: Toward a General Theory of Externalities
Abstract: This paper treats reciprocal externalities as a special case of how people interact. Two-person two-choice games are used to construct a theory and taxonomy of interactions and to show that separability of objective functions (utility, cost, or profit) is sufficient, but not necessary, for the existence of dominant strategies. The model is generalized to Nx2 games and applied to tax evasion, rural development, optimal saving and social norms.

2015: The Evolution of Innovation Networks and Spin-off Entrepreneurship: The Case of RAD
Abstract: Abstract We conducted an in-depth analysis of an Israeli startup, RAD Bynet, founded in 1981, that has intentionally, through the vision of its founder, given rise to 129 other startups employing some 15,000 workers, and created a unique “cloud”. Through a survey of the existing firms, we sought to explore the nature of this ecosystem and to quantify the relationships that exist between the mother company and the enterprises that emerge from it. Our main findings were: (a) social and technological proximity encourages the tendency of the companies to maintain business relationships that probably contribute to knowledge exchange, while technological diversity drives innovation and startup formation; and (b) firms will choose to cooperate on the basis of a shared past and personal proximity relations, as well as technological proximity at a certain level; “viral clouds” of startups like the one we studied can thus intentionally be designed and developed.

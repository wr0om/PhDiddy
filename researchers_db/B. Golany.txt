2018: A parcel locker network as a solution to the logistics last mile problem
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a parcel locker network as a solution to the Logistics Last Mile Problem: Choosing the optimal number, locations, and sizes of parcel locekers facilities. The objective is to maximize the total profit, consisting of the revenue from customers who use the service, minus the facilities’ fixed and operational setup costs, the discounts in the delivery costs for customers who need to travel in order to collect their parcels, and the loss of potential customers who are not willing to travel for service. The problem is expressed as a 0–1 integer linear program. We show that it is equivalent to the well-known Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem. We then solve the modified problem, and apply it to an industrial-sized network.

2013: Inspection games with local and global allocation bounds
Abstract: This article discusses a two‐player noncooperative nonzero‐sum inspection game. There are multiple sites that are subject to potential inspection by the first player (an inspector). The second player (potentially a violator) has to choose a vector of violation probabilities over the sites, so that the sum of these probabilities do not exceed one. An efficient method is introduced to compute all Nash equilibria parametrically in the amount of resource that is available to the inspector. Sensitivity analysis reveals nonmonotonicity of the equilibrium utility of the inspector, considered as a function of the amount of resource that is available to it; a phenomenon which is a variant of the well‐known Braess paradox. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2012: Designing patient flow in emergency departments
Abstract: Emergency Department (ED) managers can choose from several operational models, for example, Triage or Fast-Track. The following questions thus naturally arise: why does a hospital choose to work with its particular operational model rather than another? Or what is the best model to operate under? More specifically, how to fit an operational model to an ED's uncontrollable (environmental) parameters? To address such questions, we develop a methodology for ED Design (EDD): we apply it to data collected over a period of two to four years from eight hospitals, of various sizes and deploying various ED operational models. (To cover all size-model combinations, we enrich our data via accurate ED simulation.) The EDD methodology first feeds the data into a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) program, which determines the relative efficiency of each month of the different operational models of each hospital. Then, after taking into account the individual hospitals effect, we identify the operational model that is dominant under each set of uncontrollable parameters. We discovered that different operational models dominate others over different combinations of uncontrollable parameters. For example, a hospital catering to an aging population is best served by a fast-track operational model.

2012: Network Optimization Models for Resource Allocation in Developing Military Countermeasures
Abstract: A military arms race is characterized by an iterative development of measures and countermeasures. An attacker attempts to introduce new weapons in order to gain some advantage, whereas a defender attempts to develop countermeasures that can mitigate or even eliminate the effects of the weapons. This paper addresses the defender's decision problem: given limited resources, which countermeasures should be developed and how much should be invested in their development to minimize the damage caused by the attacker's weapons over a certain time horizon. We formulate several optimization models, corresponding to different operational settings, as constrained shortest-path problems and variants thereof. We then demonstrate the potential applicability and robustness of this approach with respect to various scenarios.

2012: Resource allocation in an asymmetric technology race with temporary advantages
Abstract: We consider two opponents that compete in developing asymmetric technologies where each party's technology is aimed at damaging (or neutralizing) the other's technology. The situation we consider is different than the classical problem of commercial R&D races in two ways: First, while in commercial R&D races the competitors compete over the control of market share, in our case the competition is about the effectiveness of technologies with respect to certain capabilities. Second, in contrast with the “winner‐takes‐all” assumption that characterizes much of the literature on this field in the commercial world, we assume that the party that wins the race gains a temporary advantage that expires when the other party develops a superior technology. We formulate a variety of models that apply to a one‐sided situation, where one of the two parties has to determine how much to invest in developing a technology to counter another technology employed by the other party. The decision problems are expressed as (convex) nonlinear optimization problems. We present an application that provides some operational insights regarding optimal resource allocation. We also consider a two‐sided situation and develop a Nash equilibrium solution that sets investment values, so that both parties have no incentive to change their investments. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2012: A Stochastic Competitive R&D Race Where "Winner Takes All"
Abstract: The paper considers a race among multiple firms that compete over the development of a product. The first firm to complete the development gains a reward, whereas the other firms gain nothing. Each firm decides how much to invest in developing the product, and the time it completes the development is a random variable that depends on the investment level. The paper provides a method for explicitly computing a unique Nash equilibrium, parametrically in the interest rate; for a given interest rate, the Nash equilibrium is determined in time that is linear in the number of firms. The structure of the solution yields insights about the behavior of the participants. Furthermore, an explicit expression for a unique globally optimal solution is obtained and compared to the unique Nash equilibrium.

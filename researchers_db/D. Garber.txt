2023: Projection-free Online Exp-concave Optimization
Abstract: We consider the setting of online convex optimization (OCO) with \textit{exp-concave} losses. The best regret bound known for this setting is $O(n\log{}T)$, where $n$ is the dimension and $T$ is the number of prediction rounds (treating all other quantities as constants and assuming $T$ is sufficiently large), and is attainable via the well-known Online Newton Step algorithm (ONS). However, ONS requires on each iteration to compute a projection (according to some matrix-induced norm) onto the feasible convex set, which is often computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional settings and when the feasible set admits a non-trivial structure. In this work we consider projection-free online algorithms for exp-concave and smooth losses, where by projection-free we refer to algorithms that rely only on the availability of a linear optimization oracle (LOO) for the feasible set, which in many applications of interest admits much more efficient implementations than a projection oracle. We present an LOO-based ONS-style algorithm, which using overall $O(T)$ calls to a LOO, guarantees in worst case regret bounded by $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3}T^{2/3})$ (ignoring all quantities except for $n,T$). However, our algorithm is most interesting in an important and plausible low-dimensional data scenario: if the gradients (approximately) span a subspace of dimension at most $\rho$, $\rho<<n$, the regret bound improves to $\widetilde{O}(\rho^{2/3}T^{2/3})$, and by applying standard deterministic sketching techniques, both the space and average additional per-iteration runtime requirements are only $O(\rho{}n)$ (instead of $O(n^2)$). This improves upon recently proposed LOO-based algorithms for OCO which, while having the same state-of-the-art dependence on the horizon $T$, suffer from regret/oracle complexity that scales with $\sqrt{n}$ or worse.

2023: Efficiency of First-Order Methods for Low-Rank Tensor Recovery with the Tensor Nuclear Norm Under Strict Complementarity
Abstract: We consider convex relaxations for recovering low-rank tensors based on constrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm, recently introduced in \cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results that considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and established that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the convergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may improve dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity condition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main results under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form $f(\mX)=g(\mA\mX)+\langle{\mC,\mX}\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and $\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds, which implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods, despite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth objective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal solution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require SVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank that matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the tubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor) runtime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions. 3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth saddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well known extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of independent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding tensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order tensors.

2022: Efficient Algorithms for High-Dimensional Convex Subspace Optimization via Strict Complementarity
Abstract: We consider optimization problems in which the goal is ﬁnd a k -dimensional sub-space of R n , k << n , which minimizes a convex and smooth loss. Such problemsgen-eralize the fundamental task of principal component analysis (PCA) to include robust and sparse counterparts, and logistic PCA for binary data, among others. While this problem is not convex it admits natural algorithms with very eﬃcient iterations and memory requirements, which is highly desired in high-dimensional regimes however, arguing about their fast convergence to a global optimal solution is diﬃcult. On the other hand, there exists a simple convex relaxation for which convergence to the global optimum is straightforward, however corresponding algorithms are not eﬃcient when the dimension is very large. In this work we present a natural deterministic suﬃcient condition so that the optimal solution to the convex relaxation is unique and is also the optimal solution to the original nonconvex problem. Mainly, we prove that under this condition, a natural highly-eﬃcient nonconvex gradient method, which we refer to as gradient orthogonal iteration , when initialized with a “warm-start”, converges linearly for the nonconvex problem. We also establish similar results for the nonconvex projected gradient method, and the Frank-Wolfe method when applied to the convex relaxation. We conclude with empirical evidence on synthetic data which demonstrate the appeal of our approach.

2022: New Projection-free Algorithms for Online Convex Optimization with Adaptive Regret Guarantees
Abstract: We present new efficient \textit{projection-free} algorithms for online convex optimization (OCO), where by projection-free we refer to algorithms that avoid computing orthogonal projections onto the feasible set, and instead relay on different and potentially much more efficient oracles. While most state-of-the-art projection-free algorithms are based on the \textit{follow-the-leader} framework, our algorithms are fundamentally different and are based on the \textit{online gradient descent} algorithm with a novel and efficient approach to computing so-called \textit{infeasible projections}. As a consequence, we obtain the first projection-free algorithms which naturally yield \textit{adaptive regret} guarantees, i.e., regret bounds that hold w.r.t. any sub-interval of the sequence. Concretely, when assuming the availability of a linear optimization oracle (LOO) for the feasible set, on a sequence of length $T$, our algorithms guarantee $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive expected regret, for the full-information and bandit settings, respectively, using only $O(T)$ calls to the LOO. These bounds match the current state-of-the-art regret bounds for LOO-based projection-free OCO, which are \textit{not adaptive}. We also consider a new natural setting in which the feasible set is accessible through a separation oracle. We present algorithms which, using overall $O(T)$ calls to the separation oracle, guarantee $O(\sqrt{T})$ adaptive regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive expected regret for the full-information and bandit settings, respectively.

2022: Faster Projection-Free Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Weak Proximal Oracle
Abstract: This paper considers a convex composite optimization problem with affine constraints, which includes problems that take the form of minimizing a smooth convex objective function over the intersection of (simple) convex sets, or regularized with multiple (simple) functions. Motivated by high-dimensional applications in which exact projection/proximal computations are not tractable, we propose a \textit{projection-free} augmented Lagrangian-based method, in which primal updates are carried out using a \textit{weak proximal oracle} (WPO). In an earlier work, WPO was shown to be more powerful than the standard \textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) that underlies conditional gradient-based methods (aka Frank-Wolfe methods). Moreover, WPO is computationally tractable for many high-dimensional problems of interest, including those motivated by recovery of low-rank matrices and tensors, and optimization over polytopes which admit efficient LMOs. The main result of this paper shows that under a certain curvature assumption (which is weaker than strong convexity), our WPO-based algorithm achieves an ergodic rate of convergence of $O(1/T)$ for both the objective residual and feasibility gap. This result, to the best of our knowledge, improves upon the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate for existing LMO-based projection-free methods for this class of problems. Empirical experiments on a low-rank and sparse covariance matrix estimation task and the Max Cut semidefinite relaxation demonstrate that of our method can outperform state-of-the-art LMO-based Lagrangian-based methods.

2022: Low-Rank Mirror-Prox for Nonsmooth and Low-Rank Matrix Optimization Problems
Abstract: Low-rank and nonsmooth matrix optimization problems capture many fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for smooth low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced. In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a strict complementarity condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, approximated variants of two popular mirror-prox methods: the Euclidean extragradient method and mirror-prox with matrix exponentiated gradient updates, when initialized with a “warm-start”, converge to an optimal solution with rate O(1/t), while requiring only two low-rank SVDs per iteration. Moreover, for the extragradient method we also consider relaxed versions of strict complementarity which yield a trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating both the plausibility of the strict complementarity assumption, and the efficient convergence of our proposed low-rank mirror-prox variants.

2022: Frank-Wolfe-based Algorithms for Approximating Tyler's M-estimator
Abstract: Tyler's M-estimator is a well known procedure for robust and heavy-tailed covariance estimation. Tyler himself suggested an iterative fixed-point algorithm for computing his estimator however, it requires super-linear (in the size of the data) runtime per iteration, which maybe prohibitive in large scale. In this work we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Frank-Wolfe-based algorithms for computing Tyler's estimator. One variant uses standard Frank-Wolfe steps, the second also considers \textit{away-steps} (AFW), and the third is a \textit{geodesic} version of AFW (GAFW). AFW provably requires, up to a log factor, only linear time per iteration, while GAFW runs in linear time (up to a log factor) in a large $n$ (number of data-points) regime. All three variants are shown to provably converge to the optimal solution with sublinear rate, under standard assumptions, despite the fact that the underlying optimization problem is not convex nor smooth. Under an additional fairly mild assumption, that holds with probability 1 when the (normalized) data-points are i.i.d. samples from a continuous distribution supported on the entire unit sphere, AFW and GAFW are proved to converge with linear rates. Importantly, all three variants are parameter-free and use adaptive step-sizes.

2022: Low-Rank Extragradient Method for Nonsmooth and Low-Rank Matrix Optimization Problems
Abstract: Low-rank and nonsmooth matrix optimization problems capture many fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \textit{smooth} low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced. In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a natural \textit{generalized strict complementarity} condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, the \textit{extragradient method}, when initialized with a"warm-start"point, converges to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$ while requiring only two \textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration. We give a precise trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating that using simple initializations, the extragradient method produces exactly the same iterates when full-rank SVDs are replaced with SVDs of rank that matches the rank of the (low-rank) ground-truth matrix to be recovered.

2022: Local Linear Convergence of Gradient Methods for Subspace Optimization via Strict Complementarity
Abstract: We consider optimization problems in which the goal is find a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $k<<n$, which minimizes a convex and smooth loss. Such problems generalize the fundamental task of principal component analysis (PCA) to include robust and sparse counterparts, and logistic PCA for binary data, among others. This problem could be approached either via nonconvex gradient methods with highly-efficient iterations, but for which arguing about fast convergence to a global minimizer is difficult or, via a convex relaxation for which arguing about convergence to a global minimizer is straightforward, but the corresponding methods are often inefficient in high dimensions. In this work we bridge these two approaches under a strict complementarity assumption, which in particular implies that the optimal solution to the convex relaxation is unique and is also the optimal solution to the original nonconvex problem. Our main result is a proof that a natural nonconvex gradient method which is \textit{SVD-free} and requires only a single QR-factorization of an $n\times k$ matrix per iteration, converges locally with a linear rate. We also establish linear convergence results for the nonconvex projected gradient method, and the Frank-Wolfe method when applied to the convex relaxation.

2021: Frank-Wolfe with a Nearest Extreme Point Oracle
Abstract: We consider variants of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained smooth convex minimization, that instead of access to the standard oracle for minimizing a linear function over the feasible set, have access to an oracle that can find an extreme point of the feasible set that is closest in Euclidean distance to a given vector. We first show that for many feasible sets of interest, such an oracle can be implemented with the same complexity as the standard linear optimization oracle. We then show that with such an oracle we can design new Frank-Wolfe variants which enjoy significantly improved complexity bounds in case the set of optimal solutions lies in the convex hull of a subset of extreme points with small diameter (e.g., a low-dimensional face of a polytope). In particular, for many $0\text{--}1$ polytopes, under quadratic growth and strict complementarity conditions, we obtain the first linearly convergent variant with rate that depends only on the dimension of the optimal face and not on the ambient dimension.

2021: Bacon’s Metaphysical Method
Abstract: In this paper, I would like to examine the method that Bacon proposes in Novum organum II.1-20 and illustrates with the example of the procedure for discovering the form of heat. One might think of a scientific method as a general schema for research into nature, one that can, in principle, be used independently of the particular conception of the natural world which one adopts, and independently of the particular scientific domain with which one is concerned. Indeed, Bacon himself suggested that as with logic, his method, or as he calls it there his “system of interpreting” is widely applicable to any domain, and not just to natural philosophy. [Novum organum I.127] Now, recent studies of Bacon have emphasized his own natural philosophical commitments, and the underlying conception of nature that runs through his writings. In my essay I argue that the method Bacon illustrates in Novum organum II is deeply connected to this underlying view of nature: far from being a neutral procedure for decoding nature, Bacon’s method is a tool for filling out the details of a natural philosophy built along the broad outlines of the Baconian world view.

2020: Revisiting Projection-free Online Learning: the Strongly Convex Case
Abstract: Projection-free optimization algorithms, which are mostly based on the classical Frank-Wolfe method, have gained significant interest in the machine learning community in recent years due to their ability to handle convex constraints that are popular in many applications, but for which computing projections is often computationally impractical in high-dimensional settings, and hence prohibit the use of most standard projection-based methods. In particular, a significant research effort was put on projection-free methods for online learning. In this paper we revisit the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) method suggested by Hazan and Kale \cite{Hazan12} and fill a gap that has been left unnoticed for several years: OFW achieves a faster rate of $O(T^{2/3})$ on strongly convex functions (as opposed to the standard $O(T^{3/4})$ for convex but not strongly convex functions), where $T$ is the sequence length. This is somewhat surprising since it is known that for offline optimization, in general, strong convexity does not lead to faster rates for Frank-Wolfe. We also revisit the bandit setting under strong convexity and prove a similar bound of $\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ (instead of $O(T^{3/4})$ without strong convexity). Hence, in the current state-of-affairs, the best projection-free upper-bounds for the full-information and bandit settings with strongly convex and nonsmooth functions match, up to logarithmic factors, in $T$.

2020: Revisiting Frank-Wolfe for Polytopes: Strict Complementarity and Sparsity
Abstract: In recent years it was proved that simple modifications of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm (aka conditional gradient algorithm) for smooth convex minimization over convex and compact polytopes, converge with linear rate, assuming the objective function has the quadratic growth property. However, the rate of these methods depends explicitly on the dimension of the problem which cannot explain their empirical success for large scale problems. In this paper we first demonstrate that already for very simple problems and even when the optimal solution lies on a low-dimensional face of the polytope, such dependence on the dimension cannot be avoided in worst case. We then revisit the addition of a strict complementarity assumption already considered in Wolfe's classical book \cite{Wolfe1970}, and prove that under this condition, the Frank-Wolfe method with away-steps and line-search converges linearly with rate that depends explicitly only on the dimension of the optimal face. We motivate strict complementarity by proving that it implies sparsity-robustness of optimal solutions to noise.

2020: Online Convex Optimization in the Random Order Model
Abstract: Online Convex Optimization (OCO) is a powerful framework for sequential prediction, portraying the natural uncertainty inherent in data-streams as though the data were generated by an almost omniscient adversary. However, this view, which is often too pessimistic for real-world data, comes with a price. The complexity of solving many important online tasks in this adversarial framework becomes much worse than that of their ofﬂine and even stochastic counterparts. In this work we consider a natural random-order version of the OCO model, in which the adversary can choose the set of loss functions, but does not get to choose the order in which they are supplied to the learner; Instead, they are observed in uniformly random order. Focusing on two important families of on-line tasks, one which includes online linear regression, and the other being online k -PCA, we show that under standard well-conditioned-data assumptions, standard online gradient descent (OGD) methods become much more efﬁcient in the random-order model. In particular, for the ﬁrst group of tasks OGD guarantees poly-logarithmic regret (this result holds even without assuming convexity of individual loss functions). In the case of online k -PCA, OGD guarantees sublinear regret using only a rank-k SVD on each iteration and memory linear in the size of the solution.

2020: On the Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Low-Rank Projections for Convex Low-Rank Matrix Problems
Abstract: We revisit the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for solving convex optimization problems that serve as highly popular convex relaxations for many important low-rank matrix recovery problems such as \textit{matrix completion}, \textit{phase retrieval}, and more. The computational limitation of applying SGD to solving these relaxations in large-scale is the need to compute a potentially high-rank singular value decomposition (SVD) on each iteration in order to enforce the low-rank-promoting constraint. We begin by considering a simple and natural sufficient condition so that these relaxations indeed admit low-rank solutions. This condition is also necessary for a certain notion of low-rank-robustness to hold. Our main result shows that under this condition which involves the eigenvalues of the gradient vector at optimal points, SGD with mini-batches, when initialized with a "warm-start" point, produces iterates that are low-rank with high probability, and hence only a low-rank SVD computation is required on each iteration. This suggests that SGD may indeed be practically applicable to solving large-scale convex relaxations of low-rank matrix recovery problems. Our theoretical results are accompanied with supporting preliminary empirical evidence. As a side benefit, our analysis is quite simple and short.

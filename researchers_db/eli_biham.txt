2020: K7: A Protected Protocol for Industrial Control Systems that Fits Large Organizations
Abstract: One of the main obstacles of securing industrial control systems is the lack of an appropriate security model that is both implementable by vendors and addresses the inherent security and usability issues needed by organizations. Current solutions such as device passwords and IPSec lack scalable key management infrastructure and fine granularity access control mechanisms. In this paper we propose a novel security model for industrial control systems that supports organizational level authorizations and authentication requirements, while hiding the low-level details (e.g., keys and passwords) from the users. It also allows to easily add and remove PLCs, engineering stations, HMI devices and users, and assign permissions to them. The core of the model is a new ICS secure protocol that we call K7. Without loss of generality, we base our protocol on the Siemens S7 protocol, and enhance it with new cryptographic features to support the extra functionality. We use a ticket-based system (e.g., Kerberos with LDAP server) to support the exchange of permissions and keys, and incorporate it into our protocol. To prove our solution, we implemented K7 as a protocol converter add-on to standard Siemens clients and PLCs that transform them into augmented devices that use K7. A major advantage is its support for ICS systems, that contain legacy devices, and the simple ability to upgrade their security using device augmentation. We hope that Siemens and other vendors will add direct support for K7 on their ICS systems.

2019: Rogue 7 : Rogue Engineering-Station attacks on S 7 Simatic PLCs
Abstract: The Siemens industrial control systems architecture consists of Simatic S7 PLCs which communicate with a TIA engineering station and SCADA HMI on one side, and control industrial systems on the other side. The newer versions of the architecture are claimed to be secure against sophisticated attackers, since they use advanced cryptographic primitives and protocols. In this paper we show that even the latest versions of the devices and protocols are still vulnerable. After reverseengineering the cryptographic protocol, we are able to create a rogue engineering station which can masquerade as the TIA to the PLC and inject any messages favourable to the attacker. As a first example we extend attacks that can remotely start or stop the PLC to the latest S7-1500 PLCs. Our main attack can download control logic of the attacker’s choice to a remote PLC. Our strongest attack – the stealth program injection attack – can separately modify the running code and the source code, which are both downloaded to the PLC. This allows us to modify the control logic of the PLC while retaining the source code the PLC presents to the engineering station. Thus, we can create a situation where the PLC’s functionality is different from the control logic visible to the engineer.

2018: Conditional Linear Cryptanalysis - Cryptanalysis of DES with Less Than 242 Complexity
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new extension of linear cryptanalysis that may reduce the complexity of attacks by conditioning linear approximations on other linear approximations. We show that the bias of some linear approximations may increase under such conditions, so that after discarding the known plaintexts that do not satisfy the conditions, the bias of the remaining known plaintexts increases. We show that this extension can lead to improvements of attacks, which may require fewer known plaintexts and time of analysis. We present several types of such conditions, including one that is especially useful for the analysis of Feistel ciphers. We exemplify the usage of such conditions for attacks by a careful application of our extension to Matsui’s attack on the full 16-round DES, which succeeds to reduce the complexity of the best attack on DES to less than 242. We programmed a test implementation of our attack and verified our claimed results with a large number of runs. We also introduce a new type of approximations, to which we call scattered approximations, and discuss its applications.

2012: Related-Key Boomerang and Rectangle Attacks: Theory and Experimental Analysis
Abstract: In 2004, we introduced the related-key boomerang/ rectangle attacks, which allow us to enjoy the benefits of the boomerang attack and the related-key technique, simultaneously. The new attacks were used since then to attack numerous block ciphers. While the claimed applications are significant, most of them have a major drawback. Their validity cannot be verified experimentally due to their high complexity. Together with the lack of rigorous justification of the probabilistic assumptions underlying the technique, this lead Murphy to claim that attacks using the related-key boomerang/rectangle technique are not legitimate. This paper contains two contributions. The first is a rigorous analysis of the related-key boomerang/rectangle attacks, including devising provably optimal distinguishers and computing their success rate, and discussing the underlying independence assumptions. The second contribution is an extensive experimental verification of the related-key boomerang attack against the GSM block cipher, KASUMI. Our experiments reveal that the success probability of the distinguisher, when averaged over different choices of the keys, is close to the theoretical prediction. However, the exact probability depends on the key, such that for some por- tion of the keys, the distinguisher holds with a higher probability than expected, while for the rest of the keys, the distinguisher fails completely.

2011: Status Report on the Second Round of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition
Abstract: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) opened a public competition on November 2, 2007 to develop a new cryptographic hash algorithm – SHA-3, which will augment the hash algorithms currently specified in the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-3, Secure Hash Standard. The competition was NIST’s response to advances in the cryptanalysis of hash algorithms. NIST received sixty-four submissions in October 2008, and selected fifty-one candidate algorithms as the first-round candidates on December 10, 2008, and fourteen as the second-round candidates on July 24, 2009. One year was allocated for the public review of the second-round candidates. On December 9, 2010, NIST announced five SHA-3 finalists to advance to the third (and final) round of the competition. This report summarizes the evaluation and selection of the five finalists – BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak and Skein.

2011: New Data-Efficient Attacks on Reduced-Round IDEA
Abstract: IDEA is a 64-bit block cipher with 128-bit keys which is widely used due to its inclusion in several cryptographic packages such as PGP. After its introduction by Lai and Massey in 1991, it was subjected to an extensive cryptanalytic effort, but so far the largest variant on which there are any published attacks contains only 6 of its 8.5-rounds. The first 6-round attack, described in the conference version of this paper in 2007, was extremely marginal: It required essentially the entire codebook, and saved only a factor of 2 compared to the time complexity of exhaustive search. In 2009, Sun and Lai reduced the data complexity of the 6-round attack from 2 to 2 chosen plaintexts and simultaneously reduced the time complexity from 2 to 2 encryptions. In this revised version of our paper, we combine a highly optimized meet-in-themiddle attack with a keyless version of the Biryukov-Demirci relation to obtain new key recovery attacks on reduced-round IDEA, which dramatically reduce their data complexities and increase the number of rounds to which they are applicable. In the case of 6-round IDEA, we need only two known plaintexts (the minimal number of 64-bit messages required to determine a 128-bit key) to perform full key recovery in 2 time. By increasing the number of known plaintexts to sixteen, we can reduce the time complexity to 2 , which is slightly faster than the Sun and Lai data-intensive attack. By increasing the number of plaintexts to about one thousand, we can now attack 6.5 rounds of IDEA, which could not be attacked by any previously published technique. By pushing our techniques to extremes, we can attack 7.5 rounds using 2 plaintexts and 2 time, and by using an optimized version of a distributive attack, we can reduce the time complexity of exhaustive search on the full 8.5-round IDEA to 2 encryptions using only 16 plaintexts.

2010: ABC - A New Framework for Block Ciphers
Abstract: We suggest a new framework for block ciphers named Advanced Block Cipher, or shortly ABC. ABC has additional non-secret parameters that ensure that each call to the underlying block cipher uses a different pseudorandom permutation. It therefore ensures that attacks that require more than one block encrypted under the same secret permutation cannot apply. In particular, this framework protects against dictionary attacks, and differential and linear attacks, and eliminates weaknesses of ECB and CBC modes. This new framework shares a common structure with HAIFA [3], and can share the same logic with HAIFA compression functions. We analyze the security of several modes of operation for ABCs block ciphers, and suggest a few instances of ABCs.

2010: Updates on SHAvite-3
Abstract: . In this paper we present the current state of the SHA-3 submission SHAvite-3. We address the performance of SHAvite-3, and gather some implementation data, available at the moment. We then discuss some of the issues and results concerning the security of SHAvite-3. While we prove that the SHAvite-3 family oﬀers secure hash functions, we also suggest a slightly tweaked version of SHAvite-3 512 to oﬀer a larger security margins.

2024: Better late than never? Gift givers overestimate the relationship harm from giving late gifts
Abstract: Past work has found that there is often a mismatch between the types of gifts that individuals send and the types of gifts that recipients would prefer to receive. Moving beyond gift choice, the present work explores a novel type of giver–recipient mismatch—beliefs about the importance of sending an on‐time gift. Specifically, the current work offers evidence that gift givers systematically overestimate the negative impact that a late occasion‐based gift will have on their relationship with the recipient, which occurs because gift givers believe that sending a late gift will signal that they care about the recipient to a lesser extent than what the recipient perceives. As such, gift givers' overestimation of relationship harm from a late gift is attenuated when they signal care in some other way (e.g., with the amount of effort put into creating the gift). Finally, we explore the consequences of degree of gift lateness as well as the decision to not send an occasion‐based gift at all on gift givers' overestimation of relationship harm.

2023: Meeting the Challenges to Economists of Pursuing Interdisciplinary Research on Human–Natural Systems
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research on systems jointly determined by human and ecological dynamics is critical for understanding and addressing environmental and sustainability challenges. Such research requires collaboration between the natural and social sciences. However, the high costs and irreversible investments in specialized information structures contribute to a gap between researchers’ willingness to engage in interdisciplinary research and the social value of interdisciplinary research. These attributes reinforce disciplinary specialization and lock-in. We find that the institutions and organizations needed to guide interdisciplinary research in ways comparable to disciplinary research have yet to be adequately established. Research produces a public good whose quality is uncertain and difficult to measure even within disciplines. Asymmetric information between disciplines raises costs and lowers rewards for researchers, publications, universities, and research funders. It has also led to market segmentation where some outlets publish research with insufficient quality control for either the natural science or economics components. Our survey of researchers in economics and natural sciences finds evidence of researcher perceptions and incentives consistent with disciplinary-based asymmetries and incentive incompatibilities between economists and natural scientists. The paper concludes with recommendations for individual researchers, research teams, publication and peer review, universities, and research-funding agencies.

2020: Enabling and Cultivating Wiser Consumption: The Roles of Marketing and Public Policy
Abstract: Contemporary consumers, societies, and ecologies face many challenges to well-being. Consumer researchers have responded with new attention to what engenders happiness and flourishing, particularly as a function of wiser consumption. Consumer wisdom has been conceptualized as the pursuit of well-being through the application of six interrelated dimensions: responsibility, purpose, flexibility, perspective, reasoning, and sustainability. However, up to now, the roles of marketing management and government policies with respect to enabling and supporting consumer wisdom have not been thoroughly and systematically considered. To do this, the authors adopt an integrative approach based on a range of theoretical and empirical insights from both consumer research and wisdom research in the social sciences. They weave these insights into the stages of an expanded version of the circular economy model of the value cycle, within which they also include the traditional four Ps of the marketing mix. This approach allows the authors to identify how marketing practices and public policies can enable and support consumer wisdom, resulting in advancements to well-being and the common good, as well as restorations to the missions and reputations of business and government.

2017: Underestimated Habits: Hypothetical Choice Design in Consumer Research
Abstract: Consumer habits critically impact marketing decisions, but they may be misrepresented. Two studies show the effect of habit on consumer behavior is systematically underestimated when measured in hypothetical scenarios. Participants chose between unhealthy and healthy meals (study 1) or grocery items (study 2). Vouchers to food chains representing these items were raffled between participants. In the hypothetical choice condition, participants’ choices had no impact on their compensation. In the real choice condition, participants’ choices determined which voucher they would receive. In the hypothetical choice condition, the habit to buy healthy food was positively related to the sum of healthy choices. However, as hypothesized, in the real choice condition this relationship was considerably stronger. We suggest that hypothetical contexts misrepresent the contextual cues that trigger habitual behavior. Findings suggest that consumer research in domains sensitive to habits should prefer behavioral measures. Marketing implications regarding preference elicitation (e.g., focus groups, surveys) are described.

2017: A Study Protocol for Testing the Effectiveness of User-Generated Content in Reducing Excessive Consumption
Abstract: Excessive consumption is on the rise, as is apparent in growing financial debt and global greenhouse gas emissions. Voluntary simplicity, a lifestyle choice of reduced consumption and sustainable consumer behavior, provides a potential solution for excessive consumers. However, voluntary simplicity is unpopular, difficult to adopt, and under researched. The outlined research project will test a method of promoting voluntary simplicity via user-generated content, thus mimicking an existing social media trend (Minimalism) in an empirical research design. The project will test (a) whether the Minimalism trend could benefit consumers interested in reducing their consumption, and (b) whether self-transcendence (i.e., biospheric) and self-enhancement (i.e., egoistic and hedonic) values and goals have a similar impact in promoting voluntary simplicity. A one-week intervention program will test the efficacy of watching user-generated voluntary simplicity videos in reducing non-essential consumption. Each of the two intervention conditions will present participants with similar tutorial videos on consumption reduction (e.g., decluttering, donating), while priming the relevant values and goals (self-transcendence or self-enhancement). These interventions will be compared to a control condition, involving no user-generated content. Participants will undergo baseline and post-intervention evaluations of: voluntary simplicity attitudes and behaviors, buying and shopping behaviors, values and goals in reducing consumption, and life satisfaction. Experience sampling will monitor affective state during the intervention. We provide a detailed stepwise procedure, materials, and equipment necessary for executing this intervention. The outlined research design is expected to contribute to the limited literature on voluntary simplicity, online behavioral change interventions, and the use of social marketing principles in consumer interventions.
